# CSS Code Along

## Introduction
It's time to see some CSS code in action. [Codepen][] is a great tool to easily test HTML and CSS code and it's what we will use for our example.

## Objectives
You will be able to:
* Use Codepen to preview and modify HTML and CSS files
* Uncomment CSS code

## Code Example HTML Structure

This [Pen][] (saved [Codepen][] document) contains an HTML document with the following structure:

- a [`<body>`][] element (root of the html content. In [Codepen][] we will not see a body tag, it's implicitly present and wraps all the HTML content)
- an [`<article>`][] tag to define our content as self-contained unit (e.g. blog post, newspaper article)
- an [`<h1>`][h tags] tag to wrap the [`<article>`]'s header text
- [`<p>`][] tags to wrap the [`<article>`]'s unstructured text
- [`<ul>`][] tags to represent un-ordered lists
- [`<li>`][] tags to wrap each list item

## Code Example CSS Structure

The [Pen][] also includes commented out CSS Code to (`/* this is a CSS comment */`):
- Set the background of the [`<body>`] element (whole document) to `#00b3e6` (light blue)
- Sets the [`<article>`] element width to `700px`
- Centers the [`<article>`] element
- Sets the font family of the [`<article>`] element to `Helvetica Neue`. Alternative fonts are provided in the event `Helvetica Neue` is not available on your computer
- Set the background of the [`<article>`] element to `white`
- Add 30px of white space to perimeter of the [`<article>`]
- Set the `font-size` to `22px` for the element with `id` `main-header`
- Set the `font-style` to `italic` for elements containing the class `perspective-questions`

## Code Along Instructions

Open the [Pen][] in a separate browswer tab to follow the code along instructions.

All the CSS code you need to successfully modify the page is already included but commented out. All you need to do is uncomment all the `CSS declarations` (`property-name`:`value`) one by one.
