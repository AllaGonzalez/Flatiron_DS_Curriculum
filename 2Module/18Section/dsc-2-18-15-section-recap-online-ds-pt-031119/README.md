## Introduction

This short lesson summarizes the topics we covered in section 18 and why they'll be important to you as a data scientist.

## Objectives
You will be able to:
* Understand and explain what was covered in this section
* Understand and explain why this section will help you become a data scientist

## Key Takeaways

Sometimes the data you need for a project is only available by scraping websites. Because of that it's important to be familiar with the basics of HTML and CSS and to be comfortable scraping data using a tool like Beautiful Soup. Key takeaways from this section:
* HTML is used to mark up text to provide more meaning (is this an image, an element in a list or a page title)
* Don't worry if you're unfamiliar with a given HTML tag - it's always easy to find information about it. The goal of this section was to give you a starting point - not a comprehensive understanding!
* CSS is used to style web pages
* Beautiful soup is a great package for scraping information from static websites
