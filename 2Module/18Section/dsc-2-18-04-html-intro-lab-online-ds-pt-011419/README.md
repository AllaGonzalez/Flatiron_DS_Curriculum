# HTML Intro - Lab

## Introduction

It's time to practice making a well formated HTML document!

## Objectives
You will be able to:
* Add an appropriate `doctype` tag at the top of an HTML file.
* Enclose the HTML contents of a site inside `html` tags.
* Structure an HTML document with `head` and `body` tags.
* Add `title` tags to give the page a title that will show up in the browser
tab.

## The In-Browser IDE

We want to make it easy for you to both be able to edit an HTML file and for us to be able to run tests to verify that your code is correct. Rather than asking you to do this locally, we're just going to take advantage of the Learn in-browser IDE. You'll see a button towards the top of this page "Open IDE" (just to the left of the GitHub and Raise Issue icons). When we ask you to edit a file "in your text editor", just click on that link, click on the index.html file name in the left hand column.

If the button doesn't appear to work for you (it opens up blank), go [here](https://learn.co/account/environment) and set your learning environment to "IDE in broswer".

When you run your tests, just type `learn` into the bottom of the three boxes which is a terminal for you to use with the in-browser IDE. Once your tests are passing, type `learn submit` there to tell us that you're done!


## Instructions

Open `index.html` in your text editor (the in-browser IDE). Add a `doctype` tag at the top of the
file indicating that the rest of the file will be HTML code. Then create
opening and closing `html` tags to enclose the remainder of your page's
content. Add opening and closing `head` and `body` tags within the outer
`html` tags to break your HTML document up into two sections. Remember, the
`head` section generally contains data intended for the web browser, and the
`body` section contains the content our users will see and interact with on the
page.

Then add a `title` within the `head` and make sure that it isn't blank.

You can run the tests with this lab via `learn`. Make sure you save the file
before running the test suite. Failing tests will provide helpful error
messages that you can use to debug your code — read them closely for hints!

## Viewing your work in the browser

While working through these assignments, your general workflow should center on
writing code in the text editor and periodically running the test suite in the
terminal to check your work.

Another great way to track your progress is to open up the HTML document in
your browser and watch how each change you make in the text editor affects the
visual layout in the browser. If you're using a local development environment,
you can open the HTML file directly in your browser. If you're coding in the
Learn IDE, check out this [Help Center article](http://help.learn.co/the-learn-ide/common-ide-questions/viewing-html-pages-in-the-learn-ide)
that explains how to spin up and connect to a simple remote server.

Once you have the HTML document open in your browser, you can make changes to
it in the text editor, save the file, refresh the page in the browser, and see
the changes instantly.

## Summary

Well done! You just practiced writing your own structured HTML document!
