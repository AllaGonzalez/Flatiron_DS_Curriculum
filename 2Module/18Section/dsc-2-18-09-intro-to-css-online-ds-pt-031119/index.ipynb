    "\n",
    "HTML and CSS play two different roles. When we write HTML, we focus on\n",
    "structure, hierarchy, and meaning &mdash; the \"marking-up\" of content.\n",
    "Questions in the mind of an HTML author are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Is it best to list these members' names with numbers, or bullets?\n",
    "* Does this menu belong in in the navigation in the header?\n",
    "* Should this additional reference be an aside, or a separate section?\n",
    "\n",
    "These questions deal with structure, hierarchy, and meaning, which are\n",
    "are concerns of the content layer (HTML).\n",
    "\n",
    "When defining the presentation layer (CSS), here are the questions we ask\n",
    "ourselves:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Do we want the header menu to be stationary, or does it scroll with the\n",
    "  browser window?\n",
    "* How do we want the content to display inside of a container? For example,\n",
    "  does it fill the whole area, edge-to-edge? Is there white space around\n",
    "  the content and/or the container?\n",
    "* How large should an `H1` be relative to an `H2`? What about an `H3`?\n",
    "* What properties should links have? Underline or no underline?\n",
    "  Which color for the normal state versus the hover state? Should the\n",
    "  visited link state be different?\n",
    "* How should the content appear when on a desktop machine versus a\n",
    "  mobile device?\n",
    "\n",
    "As you ask yourself these questions, your focus is on the *aesthetic* quality\n",
    "of the page. For each bit of _content_ we can define a _presentation rule_\n",
    "that will change the way the HTML is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## List the Basics of CSS\n",
    "\n",
    "For each _presentation rule_, there are 3 things to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What is the specific HTML we want to style?\n",
    "2. What are the qualities we want to modify (e.g. the properties of text\n",
    "   in a paragraph)?\n",
    "3. _How_ do we want to modify the qualities of the element (e.g. font\n",
    "   family, font color, font size, line height, letter spacing etc.)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've decided what to modify and how, we can start writing CSS rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "CSS selectors are a way of declaring which HTML elements you wish to style.\n",
    "Selectors can appear a few different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The type of HTML element(`h1`, `p`, `div`, etc.)\n",
    "- The value of an element's `id` or `class` (`<p id='idvalue'></p>`, `<p\n",
    "  class='classname'></p>`)\n",
    "- The value of an element's attributes (`value=\"hello\"`)\n",
    "- The element's relationship with surrounding elements (a `p` within an element\n",
    "  with class of `.infobox`)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if you want the body of the page to have a black background, your\n",
    "selector syntax may be `html` or `body`. For anchors, you selector would be\n",
    "`a`. A few more examples are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```css\n",
    "/*\n",
    "The CSS comment syntax is text between \"slash-star\" and \"star-slash\"\n",
    "*/\n",

    "selects all anchor tag elements in the document (e.g. <a href=\"page-link.html\">Page Link</a>)\n",
    "*/\n",
    "a\n",
    "\n",
    "/*\n",
    "selects all headers of type h3 in the document (e.g. <h3>Type selectors</h3>)\n",
    "*/\n",
    "h3\n",
    "\n",
    "/*\n",
    "selects all paragraph elements in the document (e.g. <p>Type selectors are used\n",
    "to...</p>)\n",
    "*/\n",
    "p\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "[Type selectors documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Type_selectors)\n",
    "\n",
    "The element type `class` is a commonly used selector. Class selectors are used\n",
    "to **select all elements that share a given class name**. The class selector\n",
    "syntax is: `.classname`. Prefix the class name with a '.'(period).\n",
    "\n",
    "```css\n",
    "/*\n",
    "select all elements that have the 'important-topic' classname (e.g. <h1 class='important-topic'>\n",
    "and <h1 class='important-topic'>)\n",
    "*/\n",

    "and <p class='helpful-hint'>)\n",
    "*/\n",
    ".helpful-hint\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the `id` selector to style elements. However, **there should\n",
    "be only one element with a given id** in an HTML document. This can make\n",
    "styling with the ID selector ideal for one-off styles. The `id` selector syntax\n",
    "is: `#idvalue`. Prefix the id attribute of an element with a `#` (which is\n",
    "called \"octothorpe,\" \"pound sign\", or \"hashtag\").\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Each element has a list of qualities that can be styled.  CSS \"property\" names\n",
    "identify those qualities. For text styling, examples of property names include\n",
    "text `color`, `text-align` and `line-height`.\n",
    "\n",
    "CSS Property Values are directly related to property names. If we are working\n",
    "with the `color` property, the value could be a named color such as `red`, or\n",
    "`#660000`. Some properties have their values set with words, others with\n",
    "numbers, and some can take both.\n",
    "\n",
    "A CSS property name with a CSS property value is a **CSS declaration**.\n",

    "element, you need to combine your CSS declaration with a CSS selector. The\n",
    "association between one or more CSS declarations and a CSS selector is called a\n",
    "**CSS declaration block**. CSS declarations (one or more) that applied to a\n",
    "specific selector are wrapped by curly braces (`{ }`).  Each declaration inside\n",
    "a declaration block **must** be separated by a semi-colon (`;`).\n",
    "\n",
