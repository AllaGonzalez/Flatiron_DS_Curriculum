    "##  Introduction\n",
    "When developing a Web application as we saw in previous lesson, the request/response cycle is a useful guide to see how all the components of the app fit together. The request/response cycle traces how a user's request flows through the app. Understanding the request/response cycle is helpful to figure out which files to edit when developing an app (and where to look when things aren't working). This lesson will show how this setup works using python. \n",

    "Dealing with HTTP requests could be a challenging task  any programming language. Python with two built-in modules, `urllib` and `urllib2` to handle these requests but these could be very confusing  and the documentation is not clear. This requires the programmer to write a lot of code to make even a simple HTTP request.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make these things simpler, one easy-to-use third-party library, known as` Requests`, is available and most developers prefer to use it instead or urllib/urllib2. It is an Apache2 licensed HTTP library powered by urllib3 and httplib. Requests is add-on library that allows you to send HTTP requests using Python. With this library, you can access content like web page headers, form data, files, and parameters via simple Python commands. It also allows you to access the response data in a simple way.\n",
