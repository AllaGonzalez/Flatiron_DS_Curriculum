    "We've now covered an example API request, but how on Earth would you know how to do that on your own? The answer is through documentation! All APIs will have associated documentation, and while there are substantial similarities, all will be different to one degree or another. The best way to get more comfortable is to practice! So with that, let's take a look at the yelp documentation associated with our previous example.  \n",

The last piece in working with APIs is developing a more solid understanding of JSON files; the data format typically returned by modern APIs. Take some additional time and familarize yourself with some further aspects of the documentation which you may wish to investigate in the upcoming lab!"
