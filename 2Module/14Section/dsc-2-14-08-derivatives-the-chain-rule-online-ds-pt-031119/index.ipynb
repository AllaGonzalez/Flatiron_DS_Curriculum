    "So far we have seen that the derivative of a function is the instantaneous rate of change of that function.  In other words, how does a function's output change as we change one of the variables.  In this lesson, we will learn about the chain rule, which allows us to see how a function's output change as we change a variable that function does not directly depend on.  The chain rule may seem complicated, but it is just a matter of following the prescribed procedure.  Learning about the chain rule will allow us to take the derivative of more complicated functions that we will encounter in machine learning."
