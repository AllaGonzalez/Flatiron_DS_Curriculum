    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you'll learn how to solve a system of linear equations using matrix algebra and Numpy.  You'll learn about the identity matrix and inverse matrices, which have some unique properties that can be used to solve for unknown values in systems of linear equations. Next, you'll discover how to create an identity matrix and calculate the inverse of a matrix in Python and Numpy. \n",
