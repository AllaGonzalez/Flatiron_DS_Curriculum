    "In this lab we shall look at some interesting properties of a Dot product type matrix multiplication. Understanding these properties will become useful as we move forward with machine learning advanced linear algebra. The lab will require you to calculate results to provide a proof for these properties.\n",

    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Understand and analytically explain Distributive, Commutative and Associative properties of dot product\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each property, create suitably sized matrices with random data and prove the equations \n",
    "* Ensure that size/dimension assumptions are met while performing calculations (you'll see errors otherwise)\n",
    "* Calculate the LHS and RHS for all equations and show if they are equal or not"
