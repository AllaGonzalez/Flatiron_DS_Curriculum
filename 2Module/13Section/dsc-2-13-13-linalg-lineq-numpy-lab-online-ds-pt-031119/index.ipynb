    "In this lab, we saw how to use Numpy to solve linear equations by taking inverses and matrix multiplication and also using numpy's `.solve()`. We shall now take these skills forward and see how we can define a simple regression problem using linear algebra and solve it with numpy, only using the skills that we have learnt so far. "
