    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll make use of SQLAlchemy to execute CRUD operations on a SQL database!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identify the steps needed to use SQLAlchemy with a database\n",
    "* Understand and explain the concept of an Object Relational Mapper\n",
    "* Execute CRUD operations on a database using SQLAlchemy\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll make use of our newfound SQLAlchemy knowledge to create a database, populate it with data, and write queries to retrieve objects containing the information we want. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by setting up our database. For this lesson, we're going to create then database described in the following ERD:\n",

    "**_Question:_**\n",

    "Write your answer below this line:\n",
    "________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers have a 1-to-1 relationship with shopping carts, while shopping carts have 1-to-many relationship with items.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining Our Mappings\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin by importing everything we need to create our database and structure our mappings so that they look like the tables in the ERD.  \n",

    "\n",
    "We'll be creating a 1-to-1 relationship (Customer <--> ShoppingCart), and a 1-to-many relationship (ShoppingCart <--> Item). Take a look at the documentation for creating relationships and see if you can figure out how to set this up!\n",
