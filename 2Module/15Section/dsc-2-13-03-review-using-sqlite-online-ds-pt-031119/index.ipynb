    "\n",
    "For labs in this section, we'll be working with SQL databases, which are stored as .db (or sometimes .sqlite) files. There are two methods we can use to access the data in those SQL databases. The first is to open up a sqlite database through the terminal (Mac/Linux) or Powershell(Windows).\n",
    "\n",
    "To open a sqlite server, we can open a terminal window and type sqlite3. This will be connected to a transient, in-memory database, because we have not connected it to anything. Additional steps will be needed to save any work done to tables.\n",

    "\n",
    "By default, the Python standard libary contains a package called `sqlite3`. We can use this package to connect to SQL databases and query or modify them as needed. \n",

    "To work with a SQL database through python, the following steps are always needed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the `sqlite3` library\n",

    "3. Create a **_cursor object using_** the connection object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once these steps are complete, we can use the cursor object to execute SQL Commands. Note that if we make any changes to the database, we must commit them first - otherwise, they'll be lost when we disconnect from the database. \n",

    "## Review: what is a SQL Query?\n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"query\" refers to any SQL statement that retrieves data from your database. In fact, we've already written a number of SQL queries using basic `SELECT` statements. We've already seen how to retrieve single units of data, or rows, with queries like these:\n",
    "\n",
    "To select all of the rows from a `cats` table:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM cats;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To select only rows representing data meeting certain conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM cats WHERE name = \"Maru\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What if, however, we wanted to select the oldest cat? Or all of the cats that don't currently belong to an owner? Or all of the cats with short names?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data storage isn't very useful if we can't manipulate, view, and analyze that data. Luckily for us, SQL is a powerful tool for doing just that.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we'll walk through executing a handful of common and handy SQL queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Along: SQL Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've only queried databases, as this is a much more common task for a data scientist - its more rare to be tasked with creating or altering tables.  However, this is still valuable to know - try to work through the remainder of this notebook by executing these sql commands through the terminal!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating our Database\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code along, we'll be creating a `cats` table in a `pets_database.db`. So, let's navigate to our terminal and get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "First let's create our `pets_database` by running the following command.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sqlite3 pets_database.db\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a database, let's create our `cats` table along with `id`, `name`, `age`, `breed`, and `owner_id` columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE cats (\n",
    "\tid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "\tname TEXT,\n",
    "\tage INTEGER,\n",
    "\tbreed TEXT,\n",
    "\towner_id INTEGER\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Good work. Let's type `ls` in the terminal and see what just happened. A new file should appear called `pets_database.db`! This is the binary representation of the database. You can think of this like a .jpg file. It won't open up in a text editor, but it does open up in the image viewer app. It is the same way for .db files. They won't open in your editor, but they can be read by the appropriate database engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's add some cats to our `cats` table to make this more interesting:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "sqlite> INSERT INTO cats (name, age, breed, owner_id) VALUES (\"Maru\", 3 , \"Scottish Fold\", 1);\n",
    "sqlite> INSERT INTO cats (name, age, breed, owner_id) VALUES (\"Hana\", 1 , \"Tabby\", 1);\n",
    "sqlite> INSERT INTO cats (name, age, breed) VALUES (\"Lil\\' Bub\", 5, \"American Shorthair\");\n",
    "sqlite> INSERT INTO cats (name, age, breed) VALUES (\"Moe\", 10, \"Tabby\");\n",
    "sqlite> INSERT INTO cats (name, age, breed) VALUES (\"Patches\", 2, \"Calico\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's check out our `cats` table now:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "sqlite> SELECT * FROM cats;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This should return:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "1|Maru|3|Scottish Fold|1\n",
    "2|Hana|1|Tabby|1\n",
    "3|Lil\\' Bub|5|American Shorthair|\n",
    "4|Moe|10|Tabby|\n",
    "5|Patches|2|Calico|\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Top-Tip:** You can format the output of your select statements with a few helpful options:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    ".headers on       # output the name of each column\n",
    ".mode column     # now we are in column mode, enabling us to run the next two .width commands\n",
    ".width auto      # adjusts and normalizes column width\n",
    "# or\n",
    ".width NUM1, NUM2 # customize column width\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the first two commands and then execute the above `SELECT` statement instead and you should see something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "id          name        age         breed          owner_id  \n",
    "----------  ----------  ----------  -------------  ----------\n",
    "1           Maru        3           Scottish Fold  1         \n",
    "2           Hana        1           Tabby          1         \n",
    "3           Lil\\' Bub   5           American Shor            \n",
    "4           Moe         10          Tabby                    \n",
    "5           Patches     2           Calico                   \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Much better.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### `ORDER BY`\n",
    "\n",
    "The first query modifier we'll explore is `ORDER BY`. This modifier allows us to order the table rows returned by a certain `SELECT` statement. Here's a boilerplate `SELECT` statement that uses `ORDER BY`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT column_name FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name ASC|DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's select our cats and order them by age:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "sqlite> SELECT * FROM cats ORDER BY age;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This should return the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "id          name        age         breed       owner_id  \n",
    "----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------\n",
    "2           Hana        1           Tabby       1         \n",
    "5           Patches     2           Calico                \n",
    "1           Maru        3           Scottish F  1         \n",

    "4           Moe         10          Tabby                 \n",
    "```\n",
    "When using `ORDER BY`, the default is to order in ascending order. If we want to specify though, we can use `ASC` for \"ascending\" or `DESC` for \"descending.\" Let's try to select all of our cats and sort them by age in descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "sqlite> SELECT * FROM cats ORDER BY age DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This should return\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "id          name        age         breed       owner_id  \n",
    "----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `LIMIT`\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we want the oldest cat? If we want to select extremes from a database table––for example, the employee with the highest paycheck or the patient with the most recent appointment––we can use `ORDER BY` in conjunction with `LIMIT`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`LIMIT` is used to determine the number of records you want to return from a dataset. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM cats ORDER BY age DESC LIMIT 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This part of the statement: `SELECT * FROM cats ORDER BY age DESC` returns all of the cats in order from oldest to youngest. Setting a `LIMIT` of `1` returns just the first, i.e. oldest, cat on the list.\n",

    "Execute the above statement in your terminal and you should see:\n",

    "\n",
    "```sql\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### `BETWEEN`\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've already established, being able to sort and select specific data sets is important. Continuing on with our example, let's say we urgently need to select all of the cats whose age is between 1 and 3. To create such a query, we can use `BETWEEN`.
