    "## Introduction\n",

    "In this lesson, we'll learn how to use SQLAlchemy to write queries about Microsoft's _Northwind Traders_ database!\n",

    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Read and understand an ERD diagram\n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to complete this lab, we'll need to download a SQLite3-compatible version of the _Northwind Traders_ database from Microsoft.  Microsoft built this database back in the year 2000 to help showcase their SQL Server technology. Since then, it has been open-sourced and has become a great practice tool for every new generation of SQL learners. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lucky for us, some generous programmers have already converted the Northwind database to a sqlite-compatible version and posted it on Github. We've already included the file the SQL database file that we'll be working with in the repo for this folder, along with the following ERD Diagram. However, if you would like to work with the larger version of this dataset at a future time, just clone [this repo](https://github.com/jpwhite3/northwind-SQLite3) and follow their instructions to access it!\n",

    "\n",
    "## Connecting to the Database\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we'll need to do is connect to the Northwind Traders database, which can be found in the file `Northwind_small.sqlite`.\n",

    "\n",
    "**_NOTE:_** We won't be modifying the information in the database at all, just querying it, so there's no need to import the various things you would need to create declarative base classes and the like."
