    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this lab, we'll make use of everything we've learned about pandas, data cleaning, and Exploratory Data Analysis. In order to complete this lab, you'll have to make import, clean, combine, reshape, and visualize data to answer questions provided, as well as your own questions!\n",

    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",

    "## The Dataset\n",
    "In this lab, we'll work with the comprehensive [Super Heroes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/claudiodavi/superhero-set/data), which can be found on Kaggle!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "* Use all available pandas knowledge to clean the dataset and deal with null values\n",
    "* Use Queries and aggregations to group the data into interesting subsets as needed\n",
    "* Use descriptive statistics and data visualization to find answers to questions we may have about the data. \n",
