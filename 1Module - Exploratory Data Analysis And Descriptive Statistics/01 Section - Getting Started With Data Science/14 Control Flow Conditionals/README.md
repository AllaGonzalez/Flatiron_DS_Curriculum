# Control Flow: Conditionals

## Introduction

We have talked about different data types, how to use them, and the kinds of operations that we can perform on them. We have also talked about using Booleans (`True` or `False`) to inform decisions in our programming. Often when we want to implement a decision in our code, we'll use conditionals. Conditionals allow us to break up our code in a way that we can selectively perform operations like assigning a value or even just printing text.

## Objectives
You will be able to:
* Understand and use conditionals
* Write an If statement

## Execution Flow

 So far in Python, all of our lines of code run one after the other. So in the code below, `vacation_days` is initially assigned to `0`, then it is reassigned by incrementing by one, and again reassigned by incrementing again by one, which brings the `vacation_days` to a total of `2`.


```python
# set-up vacation_days variable
vacation_days = 0

# add 1 to vacation_days and rewrite itself
vacation_days = vacation_days + 1
vacation_days = vacation_days + 1

# print how many vacation days there are
print(vacation_days)
```

    2



```python
# reset variable to 0
vacation_days = 0

# this does the same as above
vacation_days += 1
vacation_days += 1

# print how many vacation days there are
print(vacation_days)
```

    2


> The `+=` is used to add the current value and a new value and assign the resulting value. The statement `vacation_days += 1` can be thought of as `vacation_days = vacation_days + 1`. 
On line 1 we assign `vacation_days` the value `0`. So, on line two, we reassign `vacation_days` to equal the current value of `vacation_days`, which is `0`, plus `1`. Again we increment vacation_days on line 3, which would now equate to `1 + 1`, and finally we output the new value of `vacation_days`, `2`.

## If Statement
In Python there are three conditional statements, `if`, `elif`, and `else`. Every conditional statement is required to begin with an `if`. `elif` and `else` are not always required. `elif` is short for **else if**.

Now what if we wanted to only increment our vacation days based on a condtion? We could imagine a condition in this context being whether or not we hit our goals this quarter at work. If that condition were `True` we would want to increase our vacation days. However, if that condition is not `True` we can't increase our vacation time. Let's look at the code below that contains an `if` statement. 

Code that is part of an `if` statement *block* runs only when the condition evaluates to `True`. So if the condition evaluates to `False` our block of code will not be run and it moves on to the next block. 

> **Note:** A *block* is any code that is grouped together. With conditionals, we indicate that something is part of the *block* by indenting. So the line `vacation_days += 1` is indented to ensure that it is run as a part of the conditional argument below. To end the block we simply stop indenting.


```python
vacation_days = 1
if True:
    # all code indented under the if statement is the block
    # indented code runs since conditional argument is True
    vacation_days += 1
    print("vacation_days = ", vacation_days)
    print("we incremented vacation days")
# if block ends
```

    vacation_days =  2
    we incremented vacation days


Because our condition was `True`, our block of code ran. We added 1 day to our `vacation_days` variable and printed two statements. 

What if the first conditional was set to `False` but we wanted to make sure there is *some* code that runs no matter what? That is where we can use our `else` statement.


```python
vacation_days = 1
if False:
    # if block starts    
    # code does not run since conditional argument is False
    vacation_days += 1
    print("vacation_days = ", vacation_days)
    print("we incremented vacation days")
# if block ends    
else:
    # else block starts
    print("vacation_days = ", vacation_days)
    print("we did NOT increment vacation days")
# else block ends
```

Above we can see that the condition following the `if` is `False` and the code directly underneath is not run. The variable `vacation_days` stays assigned to the number 1. However, since we now have an `else` statement, our `if` block gets skipped and we then move on to the block of code underneath our `else` statement, which we can see prints the number of vacation days and a message indicating that we did not increment the vacation days.

But what if we have a second condition? Let's say we really worked hard and exceeded all our goals for the quarter? Maybe instead of incrementing just `1` day, we increment our vacation days by `2`! The third conditional statement is an `elif` statement, which is essentially another `if` statement that follows the first `if` statement. `elif` still requires a condition and a block of code, but it only comes after an `if` statement or another `elif` statement. 

Let's take a look:


```python
vacation_days = 1
if False:
    # code does not run since conditional argument is False
    vacation_days += 1
    print("vacation_days = ", vacation_days)
    print("we incremented vacation days")
elif True:
    print("We are now in our elif statement!")
    print("This means that we exceeded our goals this quarter")
    print("We will increase our vacation days by two")
    vacation_days += 2
    print("vacation_days = ", vacation_days)
else:
    print("vacation_days = ", vacation_days)
    print("we did NOT increment vacation days")
```

It is important to note that an `else` block comes last and will **always** run if the conditions before it are false.

## Truthiness

![truthiness](truthiness.png "Truthiness")

So far our conditionals have depended on whether something evaluates exactly to `True` or `False`.  But conditionals don't force us to be so precise. Conditionals also consider some values `True` if they are `truthy` and `False` if they are `falsy`.  Take a look at the following:


```python
vacation_days = 1
if vacation_days:
    # this is run
    vacation_days += 1
vacation_days
```




    2



Even through `vacation_days` did not evaluate to `True`, it still ran the code in the `if` block because the value for `vacation_days` was `1`, which is considered `truthy`.

So, from this we can surmize that numbers are **truthy** values. EXCEPT, in Python `0` is **not** considered a truthy value.   


```python
vacation_days = 0
if vacation_days:
    # this is not run
    vacation_days += 1
vacation_days
```




    0



If `0` is **not truthy**, and it is not `True` or `False`, what is it? Just as Python has **truthy** values, it has **falsy** values (or values that are treated as False in conditional statements), and `0` is considered a falsy value. 

Above, we can see that the `if` block was not run and `vacation_days` was not incremented, almost as if `vacation_days` evaluated to `False`. 

So what is truthy and what is falsy in Python?  Zero is falsy, and `None` is falsy.  Also falsy are values like empty strings (`""`) and empty lists (`[]`), which we will learn more about in later lessons. Let's take a look at this. 


```python
greeting = ''
if greeting:
    greeting += 'Hello'
else:
    greeting += 'Goodbye'
greeting
```




    'Goodbye'



If we are ever curious about the whether something is truthy or falsy in Python, we can just ask with the `bool` function.


```python
bool(0) # False
```




    False




```python
bool(1) # True
```




    True




```python
bool('')
```




    False




```python
bool([])
```




    False



Boolean values (`True` and `False`) can also be used in mathematical equations. `True` is set to 1 and `False` is set to 0.


```python
True + 5 + True
```




    7




```python
True - False - False + True
```




    2




```python
True * 4
```




    4



We can see how this can be put to use in an If statement


```python
test_var = 1

if test_var:
    print('Truthy')
else:
    print('Falsey')
```

## Using Data to Make Decisions

Our code in conditional arguments becomes more interesting when we use conditional arguments that are less direct than just `True` or `False`.

Let's say you have a management system that allows employees to put in their vacation days and the system has a way of auto tagging vacations as disruptive, average, or minimal based on the number of days being taken off. This helps to give immediate feedback for you so that you can make sure to plan deadlines and staff projects  appropriately. So, we'll use conditional statements that use the number of days taken off as the input to figure out if the vacation is disruptive, normal, or minimal. 

Let's start out with just creating logic that creates a tag for disruptive vacations or vacations longer than 5 days off of work. All other vacations can be tagged as average.


```python
number_of_days = 7
if number_of_days > 5:
    print("#disruptive")
else:
    print("#average")
```

    #disruptive


Great, now what if we want to tag vacations that are under 3 days off as minimally disruptive? Well, we don't want to create a new if block entirely. If we do, then our else statement will always run and we'll get `#average` and `#minimal`, which is not what we want. 

So, we'll have to use an `elif` statement.


```python
number_of_days = 2
if number_of_days > 5:
    print("#disruptive")
elif number_of_days < 3:
    print("#minimal")
else:
    print("#average")
```

    #minimal



```python
number_of_days = 3
if number_of_days > 5:
    print("#disruptive")
elif number_of_days < 3:
    print("#minimal")
else:
    print("#average")
```

    #average


We can see how powerful this kind of code can be to creating dynamic and efficient programs and to makings decisions. Now, there is no need for anyone to manually rank each employee's vacations and we now have a system that flags vacations that might need some special planning by management in order to keep work running smoothly.

### Summary

In this lesson, we saw how conditionals allow us to make decisions with our code by only executing code under the `if` statement when the conditional argument is `True` or truthy.  We then saw how we can use the `else` statement to only run code when the conditional argument is `False` or falsy, and as we know, code that is not in a conditional block is still run as normal. Next We examined what is truthy or falsy, and saw that None, 0, empty strings and lists are all falsy. If we are unsure, we can use the `bool` function to see a the boolean value of a piece of data. Finally, we brought it all together and used `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements together to make decisions based on the conditions of our problem.
