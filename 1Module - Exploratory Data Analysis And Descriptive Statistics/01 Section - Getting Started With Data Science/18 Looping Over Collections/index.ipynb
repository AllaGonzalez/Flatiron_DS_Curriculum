Perhaps we could already do that by writing out a line of code for each element in the collection, but that wouldn't be very efficient, would it? No, not at all. With loops, we can write one line of code that operates on each element in a collection. Pretty cool, right? Let's get started!"

Similarly to how we name a variable for the element in a list for a for loop, we name a variable for both the **key** and **value** when we iterate over a dictionary.

    "In this lesson, we learned how to use loops to iterate through a collection of elements. We started with iterating through a list of numbers, and performed the same operation on each number. Then we saw how we can loop through the numbers and have each number be used to access a successive element from a separate list, like `countries`.  We then saw that to ensure that our list of numbers matched the indices of a our other list, we had to use the expression, `for element in list(range(0, len(list)))`. Finally, we introduced a naming convention that is commonly used when naming the variable for our loops when iterating over a collection that is a list of common elements (i.e. `ice_cream_flavor` for a list of `ice_cream_flavors`)."
