We will see these terms **a lot** going forward and having a clear understanding of them is imperative. An **argument** is the data that we pass to a function before execution (i.e. `'sally'` in the example above). However, a **parameter** is the variable we define in the *function signature* (i.e. `traveller` in the example above).
