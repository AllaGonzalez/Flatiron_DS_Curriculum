    "Earlier in the course, we learned how to iterate over collections. But is there is a way to have a loop **without** a collection to iterate over? Well, another way to create a loop is with **while** loops. We can use a while loop to perform the same action over and over until a condition is no longer `True`. We don't even need an *iterable* or collection to iterate over. We can just define a condition and perform the given code block until the condition is no longer `True`. Pretty cool, right?   \n",

To perform operations like these we'll need `break` and `continue` statements. These statements **control the flow** of our loops and will help us make our loops even more effective."

    "Okay, so, let's unpack what's happening here. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we have a for loop that is iterating over our list, `numbers`, which has 30 numbers in it. Then we see that we have an if statement that only executes it's code when our `new_list` has more than 4 numbers in it. Once this condition is met, we **break** out of our loop. We then have an `elif` statement that adds any even number to the `new_list`, and a final `elif` statement that tests to see if the number is odd, and if it is odd, then it **continue**s to the next element in our for loop's iteration process. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, first let's dig into the `continue` statement. `continue` is telling our loop to **skip** any code that comes after it and go straight to the next element in our loop. So, if we are dealing with number `1` in our list of numbers, we will hit our `continue` statement and immediately go to the next element in our for loop (i.e. `2`). Any code that comes after the `continue` will **not** be executed, **but** our for loop does **not** end execution. This contrasts with the `break` statement. Our break statement is only executed when we have met our condition that the `new_list` has reached the number of elements we want it to have. Once the `break` statement is executed, it will end the execution of the for loop altogether. All code after the `break` statement will be ignored, similar to our `continue`, but there will be no next step to the iteration. It stops the loop and that's the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, essentially, we can use `continue` to *skip* operation on elements and code below the continue. We can then use `break` when we have a condition that tells us we want to stop the process altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can look at two examples to really reinforce this difference in execution."

    "Awesome! While loops are great, right? We can use them to perform operations based on the truthiness of a condition instead of needing to iterate over the elements in a collection. They provide a more dynamic way to perform operations, but we need to be careful when writing while loops because we need there to be a condition that ends the loop. Otherwise we will have an **infinite** loop which will give us and our computer a real headache. In this lesson, we also introduced some *control flow* statements, `break` and `continue`, which allow us to make our conditional statements and the rest of our code more efficient and more readable. We call these statements conrtol flow statements because they allow us to *control* the *flow* of our code's execution. "
