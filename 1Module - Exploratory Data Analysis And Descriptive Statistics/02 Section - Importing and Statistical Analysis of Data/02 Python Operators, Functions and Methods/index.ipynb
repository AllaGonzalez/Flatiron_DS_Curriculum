    "Next we looked at operators in Python. Operators are fundamental tools in many languages that provide a succicnt way to compare multiple elements. Comparison operators return boolean values and compare the value between two elements. Logical operators compare the truthiness and falsiness of two elements and either return one of the elements or a boolean value. Logical operators compare two elements for their equality, that is whether they are the same object or not, and they return a boolean value. Lastly, ternary operators are used to assign a value to a variable. They use an if statement and another operator to compare two values and return one of two values, which is used to assign the value of a variable."
