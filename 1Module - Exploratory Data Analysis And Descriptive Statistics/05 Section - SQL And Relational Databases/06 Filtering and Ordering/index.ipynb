    "To select all of the rows from a `cats` table:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM cats;\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM cats WHERE name = \"Maru\";\n",

    "\n",
    "What if, however, we wanted to select the oldest cat? Or all of the cats that don't currently belong to an owner? Or all of the cats with short names?\n",
