    "# Statistical Testing with z-score and p-value\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Before we move with some basic data analysis, we need to quickly go through a few basic concepts. This lesson will introduce a few new concepts , which we shall revisit and look in more detail during later section on statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Differentiate between statistical distributions as populations or samples\n",
    "* Understand the types of statistical testing approaches\n",
    "* Understand z-table and use sciPy to get z probabilities\n",
    "* Set up null and alternative hypotheses for statistical significance testing\n",
    "* Understand and explain the role of p-values, and significance threshold towards statistical significance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Statistical significance\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical significance is one of those terms that is often used when someone claims that some data collection and analysis proves a **point** (or hypothesis). The terminology associated with statistical significance is usually not well understood and results are accepted by masses, however, it is a simple idea that can be understood fairly easily.\n",
    "![](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/boyfriend.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical significance is mainly developed using samples and populations, hypothesis testing, the normal distribution, and p values. In this lesson, we shall build an understanding of this concept based on the statistical concepts we have studied so far. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's first look at how we differentiate distributions as samples and populations. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Population vs sample\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of every statistical analysis you will perform is the population vs sample check or to determine whether the data you are dealing with is a population or a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    ">A **population** is the collection of all items of interest to our study and is usually denoted with an uppercase N. The numbers we’ve obtained when using a population are called **parameters**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A **sample** is a subset of the population and is denoted with a lowercase n, and the numbers we’ve obtained when working with a sample are called **statistics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say we want to make a survey of the job prospects of the students studying in the Flatiron School. First question we would ask is:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is the population?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can go ahead and contact all the students studying Flatiron school campuses throughout USA and UK. But that would not be the whole population of Flatiron students. A lot of students take Flatiron's courses in an online mode. Including those students from all over the world would make a COMPLETE student population at Flatiron. Also, by the time you finish contacting all these students, you would realize that a lot of new students have enrolled onto the courses since you last surveyed. \n",
    "\n",
    "So we see populations are hard to describe and inspect in real life.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### And what is a sample ?\n",
    "A sample, however, is much easier to describe and inspect. It is less time consuming and less costly. Time and resources are the main reasons we prefer drawing samples, compared to analyzing an entire population. So, let’s draw a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we first wanted to do, we can just go to the New York campus. We can visit during the lunch hour in the canteen, because we know it will be full of people.  We can then interview 50 of them.  This would be a called a student sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-baO4QOGRINE/WvXw27RAi2I/AAAAAAAADy8/rDLGC2igVQU2wj21Nds6zvRMfcjBVQVMACLcBGAs/s1600/Capture2.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Is the sample \"representative\" ?\n",
    "\n",
    "So what are the chances these 50 can provide us answers that are a true representation of the whole student population of Flatiron globally?. You guessed it, the chances are  pretty thin. The sample is neither random nor representative of whole population.\n",
    "\n",
    ">A random sample is collected when each member of the sample is chosen from the population strictly by chance. We must ensure each member is equally likely to be chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when we spoke to 50 students in the canteen, we violated both conditions. Students were not chosen by chance, they happened to be a group of students who were there for lunch. Most students probably did not even get the chance to be chosen, as they went out for lunch. Thus, we conclude the sample was not random.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ok. So how do we make it a representative sample?\n",
    "\n",
    ">A representative sample is a subset of the population that accurately reflects the members of the entire population.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Our sample was not random, but was it representative?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Our sample represented the people who have lunch at the canteen. Had our survey been about job prospects of Flatiron students who eat in the campus canteen, we would have done well.\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, you must be wondering how to draw a sample that is both random and representative. Well, the safest way would be to get access to the student database and contact individuals in a random manner. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We said populations are hard to define and observe. Then, we saw that sampling is difficult. But samples have two big advantage: First, \n",
    "1. After you have experience, it is not that hard to recognize if a sample is representative. \n",
    "2. Statistical tests are designed to work with incomplete data; thus, making a small mistake while sampling is not always a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great, so now that we have got this out of the way, we can move on with statistical testing."

[This link](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/spss/whatstat/what-statistical-analysis-should-i-usestatistical-analyses-using-spss/) provides a quick introduction to a number of testing criteria.

    "## One-sample z-test\n",
    "\n",
    "The one-sample Z test is used when we want to know whether our sample comes from a particular population. For instance, when collecting data from successive cohorts of students taking the Data Science course,  we may want to know if this particular sample of students is similar to or different from Flatiron students in general. \n",
    "\n",
    "> The one-sample Z test is used only for tests of the sample mean. \n",

    "\n",
    "At this stage we already know what a z-score is and how to standardize a dataset and converting it into a z-distributions. By itself, the Z-score doesn't provide much information in terms of concluding a question significantly. It gains the most value when compared against a **Z-table**."

    "## The z-table\n",
    "\n",
    "A z-table tabulates the cumulative probability of a standard normal distribution up until a given Z-score. The Z-score lets us reference this the Z-table even if our normal distribution is not standard. The z-table is short for the “Standard Normal z-table”. The Standard Normal model is used in significance testing very commonly. \n",
    "\n",
    ">The area under the whole of a normal distribution curve is 1, or 100 percent. The z-table helps by telling us what percentage is under the curve at any particular point.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Here is a link to an on-line version of z-table](http://www.z-table.com/). Your repo contains a pdf version of this table. These particular values are listed in the form *.* in rows along the left margins of the table, specifying the ones and tenths. The columns fine-tune these values to hundredths, allowing us to look up the probability of being below any standardized value z of the form *.**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen that cumulative probability is the sum of the probabilities of all values occurring, up until a given point. An easy example is the mean itself. The mean is the exact middle of the normal distribution, so we know that the sum of all probabilites of getting values from the left side up until the mean is 0.5. Also the sum of probabilities from the mean to right tail would also sum up to 0.5. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"prob-mid.gif\" width=400>\n",
    "Also, recall the Three Sigma Rule when trying to calculate the cumulative probability between standard deviations. We can visualize this as shown in the picture below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"cum.jpg\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "As sum of all probabilities must equal 100%, we can use the Z-table to calculate probabilities on both sides of the Z-score under the normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"cum2.jpg\" width=400>\n",
    "\n",
    "Z-scores lets us ask go from \"how far is a value from the mean\" to \"how likely is a value this far from the mean to be from the same group of observations?\". So once again, moving from stats to probability (likelihood is measured as probabilities). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### An example\n",
    "> What is the probability of a z-score being less than or equal to 1.5 ?\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the answer using the Z-table, find where the row for 1.5 intersects with the column for 0.00; this value is 0.9332. The Z-table shows only “less than” probabilities so it gives you exactly what you need for this question. \n",
    "\n",
    "> What is the probability of a z-score being greater or equal to 1.5 ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the Z-table to find where the row for 1.5 intersects with the column for 0.00, which is 0.9332. Because the Z-table gives you only “less than” probabilities, subtract P(Z < 1.5) from 1 (remember that the total probability for the normal distribution is 1.00, or 100%). So, **1 - 0.9332 = 0.0668**. \n",

The concepts of p-value and level of significance are vital components of hypothesis testing and advanced methods like regression. However, they can be a little tricky to understand, especially for beginners and good understanding of these concepts can go a long way in understanding advanced concepts in statistics and econometrics. Here, we try to simplify the concept in an easy, logical manner. \n",
