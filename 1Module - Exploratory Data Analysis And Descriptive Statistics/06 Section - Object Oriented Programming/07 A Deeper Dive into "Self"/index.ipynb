    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this lesson, we are going to talk a little more about `self` in object oriented Python (OOP). We have seen a little bit about self when we learned about defining and calling instance methods. So far we know that `self` is always explicitly defined as our instance method's **first parameter**. We also know that instance methods implicitly use the instance object as the **first argument** when we call the method. By convention, we name this first parameter `self` since it is a reference to the object on which we are operating. Let's take a look at some code that uses `self`."

A Person can have descriptors like `height`, `weight`, `age`, etc. and also have behaviors such as `saying_hello`, `eat_breakfast`, `talk_about_weather`, etc. "
