    "\n",
    "It's hard to imagine an application that saves data but doesn't relate it. For example––a Facebook user is associated to other users via \"friendships\", an Amazon user has a shopping cart full of items, a blog's author has many posts and posts might in turn have many tags. All of these examples require different datasets to be related or associated to one another. "

    "## Relating Tables with Foreign Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing the posts and authors examples, you could say that an author *has many* posts. The reciprocal of this would be that a post *belongs to* an author. Now we need to figure out how we can represent that relationship within the constraints of SQLite. If you were writing just plain Python, how would you represent this relationship? Well we could have some dictionaries; one for an Author with the author's name, email, etc. and a key for `posts` which points to a list of dictionaries that contain all the information for a particular post (i.e. `title`, `content`, `date_written`, `author`, etc.) This is an okay way to model the relationship, but there is no data type for lists in SQL. You can only have `INTEGER`, `FLOAT`, and `TEXT`. So developers had to figure out how to relate two rows or records (a `Post` and an `Author`) using only those data types. Is there any way we can convert an `INTEGER` into a specific row in a table? OH YEAH. The `id` column or `PRIMARY KEY` for each row is a unique `INTEGER` identifier for that row. Let's say the Post \"10 Ways to Pet Your Cat\" is written by \"Joe Burgess\", and Joe's `id` is 5. We just need to add a new column to our Posts table with the `id` of the Author that it's related to. Let's call this column `author_id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why didn't we do the reverse? Why didn't we add a list of Post IDs to a single Author row? The answer is pretty straight forward. Is there an list data type? Is there really any way to store multiple items in a single column? Nope! So we just set up the relation in one direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This `author_id` column is called a **foreign key**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To associate one table to another, give one table a column called `foreign key` with a type of `INTEGER` and insert the primary key of another table row into that column. In other words, if we have a blogging app, we might have a users table and a posts table. Posts belong to the user that wrote that post. So, the posts table would have a foreign key column. An individual post's foreign key value would be the primary key ID of the user who authored that post. \n",
