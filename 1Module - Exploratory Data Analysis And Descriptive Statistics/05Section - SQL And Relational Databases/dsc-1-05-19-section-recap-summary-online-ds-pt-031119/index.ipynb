    "* Huge quantities of data is stored within organizations in relational databases and it's critical as a data scientist to be well versed in using SQL to retrive that data\n",
    "* The key benefit of relational databases is the ability to normalize your data so you don't have to repeat information in multiple placed where you might forget to update it\n",
    "* SQL also works on Pandas DataFrames, giving you another way to leverage your SQL skills when operating on data that may have come from a range of different types of data sources.\n",

    "Make sure to practice your SQL whenever you get a chance. It's an incredible powerful tool for retriving and operating on data!"
