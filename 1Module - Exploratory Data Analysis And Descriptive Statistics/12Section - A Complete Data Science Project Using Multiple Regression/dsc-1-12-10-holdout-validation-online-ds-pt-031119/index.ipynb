Usually it ranges anywhere between a 60/40 to 90/10 split for train/test data. If we have a large number of observations, we can hold back a large test set to be very sure about the validation process. For smaller dataset, we may not have the luxury of taking away 40% for the testing, so we might have to live with only  10% - or even less.\n",
