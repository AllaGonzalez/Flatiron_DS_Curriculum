Eggs Benedict for me was fab and some other good options on the menu. 
I told them we were celebrating a birthday and got a chocolate cake with a candle brought out which I was pleased to find was not included on our bill at the end!",0,fo4mpUqgXL2mJqALc9AvbA

I'm a huge fan of French food, and had definitely been craving it ever since I arrived at PH and saw that the Paris was next door.  Mon Ami Gabi definitely satisfied my craving!  A friend and I split the steak classique (steak with butter), and the quiche Lorraine.  So good!!!  The steak was perfectly cooked medium rare, as requested.  The quiche Lorraine was delicious, but I was so full by the time I got around to eating it that I only had a few bites; what I did eat was perfectly balanced.  My friends seemed to enjoy their orders as well.  I only wish that the restaurant served steak tartare... I would've been on that like white on rice!

Side note, the bread is served warm and crusty, the way it should be.  I wanted to eat the whole baguette myself, not to lie... but highly disappointing was the cold butter! 

Definitely worth coming here for a meal that is nice, but not too nice (I'm looking at you, 16-course tasting menu at JG), when you're in Vegas.",0,TVvTtXwPXsvrg2KJGoOUTg

MAKE MAKE MAKE RESERVATIONS!

Decided to leave this place as our last meal in Vegas and I wouldn't want to have it any other way. Our server made our experience 10x times better. He was extremely attentive and friendly. He knew when to stop by and when not to. He knew what to recommend and to describe how everything was prepared. I will never forget asking him what the special of the night was and how well he described it that I had to ordered it. Beef Wellington. Unfortunately, they had run out of it. So he recommended I got the filet mignon, as this is what the restaurant is well known for. I do not regret listening to him. The steak was cooked perfectly. Medium never tasted so good. My brother had the filet mignon as well but his was with mashed potatoes and mine with fries. I ended up leaving him without mashed potatoes because they were too good for me not to eat them off his plate. They were creamy, fluffy and soft at the same time. 

No wonder this place is always packed. 

They will definitely be seeing me again.",3,e3s1x4LLqfSkRTWDy_-Urg

The food was still great, but the service and the new policy of not allowing you to have a sample tasting of wine before ordering , spoiled my excitement about eating here again. We like to try different wines and the server interaction and suggestions about wine was always a highlight of the meal.",0,CnhPN2j5hsM2gJ7UPmllFA

We were seated about 12 minutes after our requested time.  Once seated we waited forever for a server.  The entire experience was just SLOW.  My meal was just average, the salad was overdressed and we had to ask for water and more drinks.

I was glad I did not suggest this restaurant since everyone in our group was let down",0,Auxu_C_QmuyM_DW0jFK_hA
