    "In this lesson, we will introduce class variables and class methods. In Object Oriented Python, we use class variables to store information that relates to the class objects instead of each singular instance object. We use class methods to access and manipulate these pieces of information as well as any operations that are specific to the class level in lieu of the instance level. We will learn not only how to define and use class methods and variables, but also how to determine what information is relevant to a class as opposed to an instance."

However, when an instance object cannot find the requested instance variable, it then checks the class to see if there is a class variable that matches what was requested. So, when we request `_species` from the `new_dog` instance, it fails to find the instance variable, but since the class has a `_species` variable, that will be returned. \n",

    "\n",
    "First, we see we still have the same class variable we started out with. Great, we understand that. Now, we see what looks like a pretty normal method called `species`, but there are two notable differences. Instead of using the `@property` decorator, which we use for instance methods, we are using the `@classmethod` decorator. Additionally, we see that the parameter in this method is `cls` (for class) instead of our usual `self`. So, what does this all mean? Let's start with the decorator, `@classmethod`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `@classmethod` decorator tells our class that this method is bound to the class scope. This means that the `cls` parameter will always be the actual class object (i.e. `Dog`). It is important to note this because it is possible to call a class method on an instance object. So, in the above example, if we had an instance object `new_dog` and invokes the species method (i.e. `new_dog.species()`), the `cls` argument would **still** point to the **class** Dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `cls` parameter is a bit more straightforward. Just as `self` is the convention for instance methods, `cls` is the convention for class methods. If both were `self`, it would be a bit confusing, so, we define the parameter as `cls` to indicate that the future argument will be the class object.\n",

With that knowledge we can safely say that it is infact the class object that should have this `_all` variable, so, it would be a **class variable**. \n",
