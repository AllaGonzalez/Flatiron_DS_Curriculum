    "In this section, the nominal focus was on how to perform a linear regression, but the real value was learting how to think about the application of machine learning models to data sets. Key takeaways include:\n",
    "* The Pearson Correlation (range: -1 -> 1) is a standard way to describe the correlation between two variables\n",
    "* Statistical learning theory deals with the problem of finding a predictive function based on data\n",
    "* A loss function calculates how well a given model represents the relationship between data values\n",
    "* A linear regression is simply a (straight) line of best fit for predicting a continuous value (y = mx + c)\n",
    "* The Coefficient of Determination (R Squared) can be used to determine how well a given line fits a given data set\n",
    "* Certain assumptions must hold true for a least squares linear regression to be useful - linearity, normality and heteroscedasticity\n",
    "* Q-Q plots can check for normality in residual errors\n",
    "* The Jarque-Bera test can be used to test for normality - especially when the number of data points is large\n",
    "* The Goldfeld-Quant test can be used to check for homoscedasticity\n"
