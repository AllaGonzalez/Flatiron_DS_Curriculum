    "In this lab, we will be looking at how to perform nested iteration (or looping). What does this mean exactly? Well, we know that a nested data structure is having one form of data nested inside another. For example, a nested list would be a list that contains another list, or a dictionary that has a key that points to a list.\n",

If we break this down even futher, we can think of the block inside of a loop as a single operation. The current iteration only moves on to the next iteration once it has completed the entire operation. \n",

The nested loop's job is to print its string three times, so that happens for each iteration of the outer loop.\n",

Nested iteration is helpful when dealing with nested collections in cases where we would like to dynamically access and use nested data contained in these collections. Nested loops can quickly become hard to read and maintain, so, it is important to use them wisely and sparingly."
