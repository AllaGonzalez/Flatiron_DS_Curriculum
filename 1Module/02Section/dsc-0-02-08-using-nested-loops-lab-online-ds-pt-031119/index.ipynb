    "In this lab, we practiced using nested loops to iterate through a nested data structure using data from a soccer match. Nested data structures can be quite complicated and it can become difficult to access more nested data. With nested loops, we are able to dynamically access this nested data and work with it as we would with a flatter data structure. It is important to think about the structure of the data before and while you're working so you know exactly what data you are working with at each level."
