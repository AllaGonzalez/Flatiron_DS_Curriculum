    "# Setting up a Professional Data Science Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "If you might want to become a professional data scientist, it’s important to take a little time to “set yourself up for success” by installing and learning to use the right tools on your computer. If you already have Git and Anaconda installed, feel free to jump down to the cloning, virtual environment setup and testing towards the bottom of the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Install a professional data science environment\n",
    "\n",
    "## What tools do professional data scientists use?\n",
    "* **Python** - There are many languages that can be used for data science, but these days most data scientists are using Python to write their code.\n",
    "* **Jupyter Notebook** - Most of those data scientists use Jupyter Notebook for writing their Python. Jupyter Notebook is a tool that allows you to mix comments in-between your code snippets so you can document and share your thinking process and make it easier for others to review, replicate and expand on your work. It's also what we're using for almost all of our lessons in this course!\n",
    "* **Anaconda** - Anaconda is one of the most popular way for data scientists to install Python and Jupyter Notebook on their computers. It also provides package management and virtual environments so you can get all the latest data science tools running like NumPy, SciPy and Tensorflow, and so you can use different versions of Python and your packages for different projects without them conflicting with each other.\n",
    "* **Git** - Git is a version control system. It’s a way of keeping track of all the changes made across your project. Think of it like “track changes” in Word - but with the ability to track changes across multiple documents. At Flatiron School, we use git to keep track of all of the lessons we create and all the changes we make to them.\n",
    "* **GitHub** - GitHub is a website where data scientists (and programmers) can save their work in case their computer breaks, and share it with their team or the world! At Flatiron School, we store all of our lessons on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s going to take us a few minutes to get this all installed, but once we do, not only will you be set-up for working through the course, but you’ll also have a professional data science setup on your computer for any future courses or projects you want to work on!"

    "## Computer Prerequisites\n",
    "There are many amazing computing devices available these days, but not all of them will allow you to do data science. We love smart phones, flip phones, chromebooks, tablets (including iPads), game boys, nintendo switches, roku’s and arduino’s. You’re not going to be able to complete this course on any of those devices - sorry.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’re going to need a computer (laptop or desktop). It should be running a recent (last 3-4 years) version of MacOS, Windows or Linux, and ideally it should have 8Gb of RAM and at least 20Gb free hard drive space.

    "\n",
    "As you do data science projects, you will spend a lot of your time using pre-written libraries to speed up your development. Examples include NumPy, Pandas and scikit-learn. As you work on different projects, you may also find that you end up using different versions of different libraries for different projects. The most common versioning issue is that some projects will run in Python 2 whereas others will run in Python 3, but you may also find that different projects depend on different versions of libraries like Tensorflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Occasionally, code that works in an old version of a library won’t work in a newer version. So if you open up a new project and install the dependencies, it’s possible that your old project won’t work any more.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid that problem, a best practice is to use “virtual environments”. Virtual environments allow you to have different versions of Python and different versions of the various libraries you use, so you can install a new version of a library for one project but still use the old version for another project. It’s almost as if you have multiple computers that you can swap between, each having a different setup and configuration, just by running a couple of commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a build in virtual environment feature in Python, but we’re going to use the more flexible virtual environments provided by conda as part of the Anaconda distribution you installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a new virtual environment, there are two steps you need to complete. The first step is to create the virtual environment. That may take a couple of minutes as your computer has to download the necessary version of Python and all of the libraries that you want to be able to use in that environment. The next step then is to “use” the virtual environment by activating it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to learn more about conda environments, have a look at the [documentation](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html), otherwise, lets give this a try.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to start by navigating into the root of this project folder, so you’re going to want to type `cd  dsc-1-01-05-setting-up-environment` in your terminal if you didn't already.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then to create the environment, on a mac, type `conda env create -f environment.yml`. On windows, type `conda env create -f windows.yml`. Depending on the speed of your computer and your internet connection it may take up to five minutes for this to complete. While it does you should see output similar to that displayed below start to appear in your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "![screen-47](http://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/data-science/screen-47.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you see a message that states “WARNING: A newer version of conda exists”, run `conda update -n base conda` and then try again to create the environment using `conda env create -f environment.yml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, try activating the environment. Whether you're on a Mac or using git bash on a windows machine, type `source activate learn-env` (if you have an issue with running git bash, the command to activate conda within the conda shell on windows is `activate learn-env`).\n",
    "\n",

    "Jupyter Notebooks run \"kernels\" - the computational engine used for executing your code. It's important to be running the right kernel within your notebook, otherwise you may get errors stating that you don't have a particular package or have the wrong version of it or even complaints about the version of Python you're running (some packages that work with Python 3.6.6 don't currently support Python 3.7, for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is essential to run `source activate learn-env` (if you have an issue with running git bash, the command to activate conda within the conda shell on windows is `activate learn-env`) every time you start a new terminal window that you are going to use to either run a Jupyter Notebook or your tests. If you don't do this you **will** get errors, so please check this first. If you are not sure whether you have activated the environment, in the terminal type `conda list -f obscure` and it should show you that you have v1.0.1 of the \"obscure\" package. If it doesn't show that, (re)run (`source`) `activate learn-env`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is one more step you need to perform. Firstly you need to ensure your terminal is running the learn-env virtual environment so you have the necessary packages. Then you need to go into your Jupyter Notebook and when viewing a notebook, click on \"Kernel\" in the top bar, then \"Change Kernel\" and then pick the learn-env kernel. You must make sure you're running the learn-env kernel whenever you're working in a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "If for any reason you don't see the learn-env option in the drop down list of kernels, exit the notebook in the browser, close down the notebook server, and in the terminal type `python -m ipykernel install --user --name=learn-env` - that will add the learn-env to your list of kernels and when you restart the Jupyter Notebook server and then open a notebook, you'll be able to select the learn-env option from the list of kernels."
