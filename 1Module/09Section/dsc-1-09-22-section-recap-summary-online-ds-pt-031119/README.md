# Section Recap

## Introduction

This short lesson summarizes the topics we covered in section 09 and why they'll be important to you as a data scientist.

## Objectives
You will be able to:
* Understand and explain what was covered in this section
* Understand and explain why this section will help you become a data scientist

## Key Takeaways

In this section, we really dug into statistical distributions. Key takeaways include:
* The difference between discrete and continuous statistical distributions
* The value of using stem and leaf plots for visualizing a data set
* How to describe the distribution of data sets using Probability Mass Functions, Cumulative Distribution Functions and Probability Density Functions.
* The characteristics of a gaussian distribution
* Differences between the normal and the standard normal distribution
* How skewness and kurtosis can be used to measure how different a given distribution is from a normal distribution
* The uses of z-scores and p-values for describing a distribution
* How a one sample z-test is a very simple form of hypothesis testing.
