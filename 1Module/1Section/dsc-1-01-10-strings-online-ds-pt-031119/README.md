# Introduction to Variables: Strings

## Introduction
As we already know from living in the digital age and the lessons we've already seen, programming is a powerful tool for answering questions about data. It allows us to collect, clean up and format our data and then perform calculations on that data.

Much of our digital information is in the form of text, for exmaple song lyrics and emails. To clean up and format that text with Python, we need to become familiar with our first type of data, the String.

## Objectives
By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
* Understand and use the **String** data type
* Understand, explain and use the correct data types for various types of information

## What Are Strings?

A lot of information in the world is in the form of text. To capture this information and operate on it in Python we take this text and make it into the **String** (`str`) data type.

Below, we have the name of a cartoon character, Homer Simpson. By putting quotes (`""`) or (`''`) around the name, we create a string.

```python
"Homer Simpson"
```
When programmers say *string*, what they mean is text.  When programmers say *data type*, they just mean type of data.  We can think of `'Homer Simpson'` as an instance of the string data type.

Here are a few other types of data in Python that we will talk more about in later lessons:
```python
100 # Integer
10.0 # Float
True # Boolean
```

Since there are several types of data in Python we can discover the type of any piece of data by calling, or executing, the `type()` function. By calling or executing a function, we mean running the function so that it executes the code within it.

Let's look at an example below:

> **Note:** Press the shift + enter keys to run the code below. The cell that populates below is the return or output of the type function.


```python
type("Homer Simpson")
```




    str



We need to pay attention to what type of data we are working with because they operate differently and have different values as well as functions that we are able to use on them. 

For example, to create a new string (or to *initialize* a string) we cannot simply type letters. Instead, we need to be very explicit and tell Python it is about to see some text. We do this by surrounding our text with quotes, `""`.  If we don't do that or end our quotation marks too early, Python will throw an error.


```python
"This is a properly formatted string!"
```




    'This is a properly formatted string!'




```python
"Th"is will throw an error!
```


      File "<ipython-input-10-08f2a98e3ef7>", line 1
        "Th"is will throw an error!
                        ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax



> **Note:** double quotes and single quotes can be used interchangeably in Python; however, for readability it is important that we stay consistent. At first, it might seem strange how picky programmers are about details like this, but after a couple of years of coding, you too might end up in a fight like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsoOG6ZeyUI)!

Strings can contain numbers as well. It may look like 42, but it if it wrapped with `'42'`, then it is a string. See the difference below.


```python
type('42')
```




    str




```python
type(42)
```




    int




```python
type(42.0)
```




    float



### Changing Data With Built In Methods

Python is picky like this for a reason. For example, once it knows we are working with a string, it gives us specific functionality for operating on strings. We call this functionality a **function** or a **method**.

Below we have a method that works with a String, but does not work with a Boolean.


```python
'Homer Simpson'.upper()
```




    'HOMER SIMPSON'




```python
42.upper()
```


      File "<ipython-input-15-8ab5bf46fc2d>", line 1
        42.upper()
               ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax



Yep.  Bad news bears.

As we can see in the examples above, we can operate on a datatype using the following format: 

   * [INSTANCE OF A DATATYPE] [DOT] [METHOD NAME] [PARENTHESES]

Here is an examples that follow this format and returns a `True` or `False` value:


```python
"Homer Simpson".endswith('Simpson')
```




    True




```python
"Charles Montgomery Burns".endswith('Simpson')
```




    False



As you can see in this notebook, most of our operations on data will follow the data-dot-method_name-parentheses format.

###  Discovering New Methods

You may be starting to worry about there being too many methods to keep track of. Let's ask Python for help with finding more information about what we can do with strings.

The `help()` function in Python comes built-in and is like an old school Alexa. We give our prompt or *data type* to the `help()` function and it tells us everything it knows about that data type.

Let's see what happens when we type `help(str)`.


```python
help(str)
```

    Help on class str in module builtins:
    
    class str(object)
     |  str(object='') -> str
     |  str(bytes_or_buffer[, encoding[, errors]]) -> str
     |  
     |  Create a new string object from the given object. If encoding or
     |  errors is specified, then the object must expose a data buffer
     |  that will be decoded using the given encoding and error handler.
     |  Otherwise, returns the result of object.__str__() (if defined)
     |  or repr(object).
     |  encoding defaults to sys.getdefaultencoding().
     |  errors defaults to 'strict'.

     |          Unicode ordinals, strings, or None.
     |      
     |      The table must implement lookup/indexing via __getitem__, for instance a

     |  
     |  maketrans(x, y=None, z=None, /)
     |      Return a translation table usable for str.translate().
     |      
     |      If there is only one argument, it must be a dictionary mapping Unicode
     |      ordinals (integers) or characters to Unicode ordinals, strings or None.
     |      Character keys will be then converted to ordinals.
     |      If there are two arguments, they must be strings of equal length, and
     |      in the resulting dictionary, each character in x will be mapped to the
     |      character at the same position in y. If there is a third argument, it
     |      must be a string, whose characters will be mapped to None in the result.
    


So, we can see from the output it gives us a lot of information regarding the datatype including built-in methods we can use to operate on data of that particular type (i.e. Strings).

**Note:** *If you type the `help()` function in your terminal and the output is longer than the window, you can press the letter `q` to exit back to normal operation.*

Holy cow that's a lot of words. If we scroll down to the word capitalize, things begin to make more sense. For example, for capitalize, this is what it says:

```python
capitalize(...)

    S.capitalize() -> str
    Return a capitalized version of S, i.e. make the first character
    have upper case and the rest lower case.
```

Our next step is to use our formula of datatype-dot-method name-parentheses, and see what happens next.


```python
"smithers".capitalize()
```




    'Smithers'



## Tips going forward

There are many other examples of methods to use with strings in Python. In fact, they are all listed when you called `help(str)` above. What is important when learning how to code in Python is to think of the right question to ask when you are stuck and learn how to read the documentation. There is a cycle to getting comfortable with Python functions and methods.

In this lesson, we went through that cycle:
* Guess: We just tried something and looked to the error message for clues as to what to do next.
* help(str): We saw a nice way to learn about new methods, then we took a guess to test our understanding
* Following a pattern: We started with a simple method like calling upper, took a moment to break this down into a pattern, and then tried this pattern again to call other methods

Here is one more method of discovery:  **just ask Google**.  For example, look what happens when we ask Google about capitalization.

[A great link with a detailed answer.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1549644)

Then we try this new method out ourselves, to see if this user on StackOverFlow is right (they normally are).


```python
"hello world".title()
```




    'Hello World'



And our work is done.

Feel free to look at [other common string operations here.](https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html)

## Summary
In this lesson, we learned about our first datatype in Python: the string.  A string is just text. We indicate to Python that we are writing a string by surrounding our content with quotation marks. Once we do this, we can operate on this string by calling methods like `upper` or `endswith`. We identified a general pattern for calling methods on datatypes: 'instance of a datatype-dot-method name-parentheses'.

The second thing we learned was different mechanisms for learning about methods.  We saw the importance of guessing and experimentation, and how doing so can give us error messages, which provide clues. We also saw how to ask questions about a datatype by calling 'help' followed by the datatype name like `help(str)`.  Finally, we saw we can ask Google.  This mechanism of exploration is a skill we'll build up over time and this course will provide guidance and practice on along the way.
