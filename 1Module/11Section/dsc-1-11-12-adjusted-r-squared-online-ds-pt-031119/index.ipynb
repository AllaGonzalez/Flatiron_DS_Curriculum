    "- R-squared uses a baseline model which is the worst model. This baseline model does not make use of any independent variables to predict the value of dependent variable Y. Instead it uses the mean of the observed responses of dependent variable Y and always predicts this mean as the value of Y. The mathematical formula to calculate R-squared for a linear regression line is in terms of squared errors for the fitted model and the baseline model. In the formula below, $SS_{RES}$ is the residual sum of squared errors or our model, also known as $SSE$, which is the error between the real and predicted values. $SS_{TOT}$ is the difference between real and mean y values.\n",

    "-  The problem with $R^2$ is that, whichever predictor you **add** to your model which will make your model more complex, will increase your $R^2$ value. That is, the model tends to overfit if we only use $R^2$ as our model fitting criterion. This is why train test split is essential and why regularization techniques are used to refine more advanced regression models. Make sure to read [this blogpost](https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/adjusted-r2/) on the difference between the two to get a better sense to why use $R^2_{adj}$ !\n"

There are several ways to approach variable selection, and we'll only touch upon this in an ad-hoc manner in this lesson.
