# Introduction

## Introduction
This lesson summarizes the topics we'll be covering in section 03 and why they'll be important to you as a data scientist.

## Objectives
You will be able to:
* Understand and explain what is covered in this section
* Understand and explain why the section will help you to become a data scientist

## Working with Pandas

After a brief introduction to the most popular data science libraries in Python, section 03 takes you deeper into importing and accessing data using the two key Pandas data structures - Series Aand DataFrames.

## Summary Stats

We then look at some of the methods built right into Pandas for generating descriptive statistics when doing your initial exploratory data analysis.

## Customizing Visualizations

We then look at how you can start to customize your visualizations in Matplotlib, and look at the data visualization capabilities exposed directly within Pandas for quick and efficient plotting.

## Welcome to Kaggle

We then introduce the very popular Boston Housing data set, and we use that as an excuse to get you set up on Kaggle - an important destination for any practicing data scientist. We then give you a project using the Boston Housing data to let you practice your statistical and visualization skills.

## Summary

In this section, we're leveraging the programming and statistical concepts from earlier sections to provide you with additional practice working with various data sets.
