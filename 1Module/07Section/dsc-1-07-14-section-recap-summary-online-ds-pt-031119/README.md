# Section Recap

## Introduction

This short lesson summarizes the topics we covered in section 07 and why they'll be important to you as a data scientist.

## Objectives
You will be able to:
* Understand and explain what was covered in this section
* Understand and explain why this section will help you become a data scientist

## Key Takeaways

We spent a lot more time in this section deepening both our knowledge of and experience of working with Object Oriented Programming concepts. Key takeaways include:
* Objects can be really useful for using software to model real world entities like companies, customers and orders
* Objects have both state (properties) and behavior (methods - functions associated to an object)
* Classes can also have state (class variables/properties) and behavior (class methods)
* Inheritance is a powerful way to reuse code by allowing (for example) a Vendor and a Customer to share properties and methods by extending from the same Company class
* Inheritance can be overused - think about "is a" vs. "has a" and [favor composition over inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance)

And after our deep dive into OOP, let's get back to the data science. In the next section we'll be learning about NumPy and the foundations of probability and combinatorics!
