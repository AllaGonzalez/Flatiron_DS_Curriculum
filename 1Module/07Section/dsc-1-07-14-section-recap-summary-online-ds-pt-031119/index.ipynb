    "\n",
    "We spent a lot more time in this section deepening both our knowledge of and experience of working with Object Oriented Programming concepts. Key takeaways include:\n",
    "* Objects can be really useful for using software to model real world entities like companies, customers and orders\n",
    "* Objects have both state (properties) and behavior (methods - functions associated to an object)\n",
    "* Classes can also have state (class variables/properties) and behavior (class methods)\n",
    "* Inheritance is a powerful way to reuse code by allowing (for example) a Vendor and a Customer to share properties and methods by extending from the same Company class\n",
    "* Inheritance can be overused - think about \"is a\" vs. \"has a\" and [favor composition over inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance)\n",
    "\n",
    "And after our deep dive into OOP, let's get back to the data science. In the next section we'll be learning about NumPy and the foundations of probability and combinatorics!\n"
