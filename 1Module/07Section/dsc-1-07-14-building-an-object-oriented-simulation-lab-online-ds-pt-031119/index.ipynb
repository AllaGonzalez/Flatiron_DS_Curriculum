    "* Infected individuals that recover from the disease are now immune to catching the disease a second time (think Chickenpox)\n",
    "* Dead invidiuals are not contagious. \n",
    "* All infections happen from person-to-person interaction\n",
    "* All individuals interact with the same amount of people each day\n",
    "* The `r0` value (pronounced _\"R-nought\"_) is a statistic from the Centers for Disease Control that estimates the average number of people an infected person will infect before they are no longer contagious.  For this value, we assume:\n",
    "    * That this number is out of 100 people\n",
    "    * That this statistic is accurate\n",
    "    \n",
    "Building simulations is always a trade-off, since the real world is very, very complex.  As we build our simulation, try to think about ways in which we could make our model more realistic by writing it in such a way that it eliminates one of the assumptions above (e.g. generating a float value for vaccine efficacy on a person-by-person level to eliminate our first assumption). \n",
