    "A domain model is the representation of a real-world concept or structure translated in to software. This is a key function of object orientation. So far, our Python classes have been used as blueprints or templates for  instance objects of that class. As an example, a Driver class would create driver intsance objects, and the class would define a basic structure for what that driver instance object should look like and what capabilities it should have. But a class is only one part of a domain model just as, typically, a driver is only one part of a larger structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "A domain model is meant to mirror that larger, real-world structure. It is more than just one class, it is an entire environment that often depends on other parts or classes to function properly. So, in keeping with a Driver class, we could use the example of a taxi and limousine service as our domain model. There are many more parts to a service like this than drivers alone. We could imagine dispatchers, mechanics, accountants, passengers, etc., all being part of the structure of this domain model. In a simplified example, we could have instance and class methods handle things like `dispatch_driver`, `calculate_revenue_from_rides`, `service_taxi`, or any other function of a taxi and limousine service.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we become more fluent in object oriented programming and our programs become more complex, we will see that the other parts of a domain model like passengers, dispatchers, etc., will be classes of their own which interact with each other. \n",

Let's imagine a reporting method for the business that will return the top 5 customers to date based on their purchase history. To do this, we will have to determine the total purchases made by customers and then sort our customers by this. Currently the data needed for that is stored within a customer object within the orders attribute which is a list of dictionaries. Quite the mouthful there; an object with an attribute that's a list of dictionaries. Breaking down the problem into constituent parts can help us reduce solving the same problems over and over again. As such, before we write a larger business function to retrieve the top 5 customers, let's update our customer object to also keep track of total spent."
