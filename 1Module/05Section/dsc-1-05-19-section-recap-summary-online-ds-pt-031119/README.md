# Section Recap

## Introduction

This short lesson summarizes the topics we covered in section 05 and why they'll be important to you as a data scientist.

## Objectives
You will be able to:
* Understand and explain what was covered in this section
* Understand and explain why this section will help you become a data scientist

## Key Takeaways
In this section, we focused entirely on SQL - both for retrieving data from relational databases and for operating on data within a Pandas DataFrame. Key takeaways:

* Huge quantities of data is stored within organizations in relational databases and it's critical as a data scientist to be well versed in using SQL to retrive that data
* The key benefit of relational databases is the ability to normalize your data so you don't have to repeat information in multiple placed where you might forget to update it
* SQL also works on Pandas DataFrames, giving you another way to leverage your SQL skills when operating on data that may have come from a range of different types of data sources.

Make sure to practice your SQL whenever you get a chance. It's an incredible powerful tool for retriving and operating on data!
