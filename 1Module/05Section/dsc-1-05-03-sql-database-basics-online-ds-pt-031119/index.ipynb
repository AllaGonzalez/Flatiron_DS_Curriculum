    "\n",
    "Relational Databases like SQLite store data in a structure we refer to as a table. You can think of a table in a database a lot like you would a spreadsheet. We define specific columns in our table, and then we store any number of what we refer to as 'records' as rows in our database. A record is just information referring to one specific entity. For instance, if you had a table called \"People\" you could imagine a structure like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| name | age | email |\n",
    "|------|-----|-------|\n",
    "| Bob | 29 |  bob@flatironschool.com |\n",
    "| Avi  |  28   | avi@flatironschool.com  |\n",
    "| Adam |  28   | adam@flatironschool.com |\n",
    "\n",

    "### Note on Column Names\n",
    "\n",
    "When we name columns in our database, there are a couple of conventions we will follow. The first is that we will always use lowercase letters when referring to columns in our database. SQLite isn't case sensitive about its commands or column names, but it is generally best practice for us to stick to lowercase for our column names.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second convention we want to follow is more important. That is, when we have multiple words in a column name, we link them together using underscores rather than spaces. We call this convention \"snake_case\". So, for instance, if we wanted to be more specific with our email column above, we can name it email_address. If we wanted to split up name to first and last we might have columns called first_name and last_name.\n"

Our SQLite database tables *must be indexed by a number*. We want each row in our table to have a number, which we'll call \"id\", just like in an Excel spreadsheet. Numbering our table rows makes our data that much easier to access, update, and organize. SQLite comes with a data type designation called \"Primary Key\". Primary keys are unique and auto-incrementing, meaning they start at 1 and each new row automatically gets assigned the next numeric value. \n",
