# Join Statements - Lab

## Introduction

In this lab, you'll practice your knowledge on Join statements.

## Objectives

You will be able to:
- Write queries that make use of various types of Joins
- Join tables using foreign keys

## CRM Schema

In almost all cases, rather then just working with a single table we will typically need data from multiple tables. 
Doing this requires the use of **joins ** using shared columns from the two tables. 

In this lab, we'll use the same Customer Relationship Management (CRM) database we used in our lecture before!
