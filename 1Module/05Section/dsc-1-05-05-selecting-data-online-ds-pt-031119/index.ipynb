    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[(1, 'Maru', 3, 'Scottish Fold')]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use comparison operators, like `<` or `>` to select specific data. Let's give it a shot. Use the following statement to select the young cats:\n",

    "cursor.execute('''SELECT * FROM cats WHERE age < 2;''').fetchall()\n",
