The is particularly important and all the machine learning approaches that we will come across later are built upon the ideas of statistical machine learning. \n",

    "\n",
    "You will be able to: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand and describe the statistical learning theory \n",
    "* Understand dependent and independent variables as key components of statistical learning approaches\n",
    "* Give an introduction on model development and model parameters\n",

    "> Statistical learning theory is a framework for machine learning drawing from the fields of statistics and functional analysis. Statistical learning theory deals with the problem of finding a predictive function based on data. **The goal of statistical learning theory is to study, in a statistical framework, the properties of learning algorithms.**\n",

    "Independent and dependent variables always go on the same places in a graph. This makes it easy for you to quickly see which variable is independent and which is dependent when looking at a graph or chart. The independent variable always goes on the x-axis, or the horizontal axis. For the height weight data that we have been seeing , a scatter plot may look as shown below. Here we have set height as independant and weight as a dependent variable i.d. we want to study if height has some effect on weight:\n",

For the plot we see above, the relationship between height and weight, in its simplest form, can be shown using a **straight line** connecting all the individual observations in the data. So this line here would be our **model** as shown. \n",

A statistical learning approach would help us **learn** these parameters so we have a clear description of their relationship which we can replicate and analyze under different circumstances. \n",

If the relationship is well modeled, the loss function will be a lower value. As you change parameters of your model to try and improve results, your loss function is your best friend, telling you if you are on the right track. Below is an example loss function which calculates a loss for fitting straight line to set of variables (as in our case above). The function tries to measure the distance between data points and line to measure the level of LOSS. \n",
