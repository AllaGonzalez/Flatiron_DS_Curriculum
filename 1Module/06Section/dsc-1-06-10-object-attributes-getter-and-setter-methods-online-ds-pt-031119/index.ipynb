    "## Introduction\n",
    "We have now covered Python classes, instance objects, instance methods, and instance variables. Now that we know what these things are and how they work together, we need to think about how we *want* these parts of our program to work together. Said another way, we need to think about making our programs a bit more secure and prevent users from making unwanted changes or creating bad data. To that effect, we will want to use design patterns for creating private instance variables or defining instance methods that provide ways to update instance variables indirectly. These methods are called setters and getters, because they both read and write (get and set) the private instance variable information we would like to access. Let's get started!"

By prepending an underscore to an instance variable, we are indicating that this variable should be treated as a private instance variable and that it should only be accessed through a getter or setter method instead of direct access. By using getter and setter methods we are able to build in validations for our instance variables ensuring that they remain the datatype and value range that we expect in our program. To make our program even more intuitive we can use property objects to encapsulate our getter and setter methods into a single object. We then are able to invoke these methods as if they were an instance variable, with the added bonus that we are using our getter and setter methods to interact with the actual instance variable."
