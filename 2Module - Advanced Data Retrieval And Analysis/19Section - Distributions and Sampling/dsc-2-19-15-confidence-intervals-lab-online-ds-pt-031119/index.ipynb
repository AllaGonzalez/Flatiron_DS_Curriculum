    "As we begin to talk about confidence intervals it’s important to remember the difference between a **sample distribution** and a **sampling distribution**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that a sample data distribution is the distribution of the data points within a single sample.  A sampling distribution is the probability distribution a statistic can take. Also recall that, by the Central Limit Theorem, the sampling distribution of the sample mean (x_hat) is approximately normal regardless of the shape of the original distribution of the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen in previous lab,  point estimates can provide some idea of a population parameter like the mean, but estimates are prone to error and also, taking multiple samples to get improved estimates may not be feasible all the time. \n",

    "if we wanted to know the average age of registered voters in some elections, we could take a survey of registered voters and then use the average age of the respondents as a point estimate of the average age of the population as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous lab we saw that sample mean is usually not exactly the same as the population mean. This difference can be caused by many factors including poor survey design, biased sampling methods and the randomness inherent to drawing a sample from a population. Let's run a simulation to investigate point estimates by generating a population of random age data and then drawing a sample from it to estimate the mean:"
