    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson is a supplement to the previous lesson where we learnt how to create numpy arrays as vectors or matrices and performed basic manipulations on these objects. In this lesson we shall look at matrix addition and broadcasting features offered by Numpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Understand and implement vector addition in Numpy \n",
    "* Understand how broadcasting differs from addition when adding mismatched dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vector Addition\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall now look at simple vector addition, where all operations are performed element-wise between two vectors/matrices of equal size to result in a new vector/matrix with the same size.\n",
    "\n",

    "Two arrays A and B with the same dimensions can be added together if:\n",
    "* they have the same shape:\n",

    "1 dimensional arrays can be added together in exactly the same way following similar assumptions. The addition of two vectors x and y may be represented graphically by placing the start of the arrow y at the tip of the arrow x, and then drawing an arrow from the start (tail) of x to the tip (head) of y. The new arrow drawn represents the vector x + y\n",
