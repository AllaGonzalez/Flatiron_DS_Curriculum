    "\n",
    "- a [`<body>`][] element (root of the html content. In [Codepen][] we will not see a body tag, it's implicitly present and wraps all the HTML content)\n",
    "- an [`<article>`][] tag to define our content as self-contained unit (e.g. blog post, newspaper article)\n",
    "- an [`<h1>`][h tags] tag to wrap the [`<article>`]'s header text\n",
    "- [`<p>`][] tags to wrap the [`<article>`]'s unstructured text\n",

    "- Sets the font family of the [`<article>`] element to `Helvetica Neue`. Alternative fonts are provided in the event `Helvetica Neue` is not available on your computer\n",
    "- Set the background of the [`<article>`] element to `white`\n",
    "- Add 30px of white space to perimeter of the [`<article>`]\n",
    "- Set the `font-size` to `22px` for the element with `id` `main-header`\n",
