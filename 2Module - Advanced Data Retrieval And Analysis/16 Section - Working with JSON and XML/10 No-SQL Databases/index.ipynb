    "## Choosing an Appropriate Database\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many consideration when choosing a database including the size of the project, anticipated use cases, and development costs. One obvious and straightforward consideration is training and familiarity. This contributes to the popularity of SQL. Size and use cases are also incredibly imporatant considerations. For personal projects or small businesses, you may not even need a database and can perhaps simply use a csv or json file. As data grows, a database management system is often needed. Until scale continues to grow, any of these choices could meet needs. One of the biggest drawbacks of relational databases such as sql is that they don't scale well horizontally (such as adding columns). In such scenarios, some of the alternative models provide more computationally effective solutions at scale."
