# Section Recap

## Introduction

This short lesson summarizes the topics we covered in section 20 and why they'll be important to you as a data scientist.

## Objectives
You will be able to:
* Understand and explain what was covered in this section
* Understand and explain why this section will help you become a data scientist

## Key Takeaways

Some of the key takeaways from this section include:
* It's important to have a sound approach to experimental design to be able to determine the significance of your findings
* Start by examining any existing research to see if it can shed light on the problem you're studying
* Start with a clear alternative and null hypothesis for your experiment to "prove"
* It's important to have a thoughtfully selected control group from the same population for your trial to distinguish effect from variations based on population, time or other factors
* Sample size needs to be selected carefully to ensure your results have a good chance of being statistically significant
* Your results should be reproducible by other people and using different samples from the population
* The p-value for an outcome determines how likely it is that the outcome could be due to chance
* The alpha value is the marginal threshold at which we're comfortable rejecting the null hypothesis
* An alpha of 0.05 is a common choice for many experiments
* Effect size measures just the size in difference between two groups under observation, whereas statistical significance combines effect size with sample size
* A one sample t-test is used to determine whether a sample comes from a population with a specific mean. 
* A two-sample t-test is used to determine if two population means are equal
* Type 1 errors (false positives) are when we accept an alternative hypothesis which is actually false
* The alpha that we pick is the likelihood that we will get a type 1 error due to random chance
* Type 2 errors (false negatives) are when we reject an alternative hypothesis which is actually true
* The beta that we pick is the likelihood that we will get a type 2 error due to random chance
* The power of a statistical test is defined as the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis, given that it is indeed false
* You should avoid swimming pools any year that Nicolas Cage appears in multiple films (kidding!)
* Spurious correlation is always a risk - but particularly when comparing multiple variables
* It's important to use corrections such as the Bonferroni Correction to deal with multiple comparisons
* Goodhart's law: "Any observed statistical regularity will tend to collapse once pressure is placed upon it for control purposes." --Charles Goodhart
* ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) tests the hypothesis that the means of two or more populations are equal
