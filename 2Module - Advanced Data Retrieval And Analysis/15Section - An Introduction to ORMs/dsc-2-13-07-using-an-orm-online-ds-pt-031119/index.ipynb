    "# Using an ORM\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll learn about **_Object Relational Mappers_**, and how we can make use of SQLAlchemy to make interacting with database information clean and easy in Python!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand and explain the concept of an Object Relational Mapping\n",
    "* Identify the steps needed to use sqlalchemy with a database\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Object-Relational Mappings\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational databases excel at storing information in a clean, encapsulated way.  So do objects in an Object-Oriented language such as python! We can easily store the information contained within a row by treating each row as a separate object, with the column values corresponding to attributes for that object.  All rows in a given table must have the same columns, which is something we can easily reproduce when creating a class in Python.  The hard part is getting our data from a relational database and storing the data needed in an object to work with it in python.  Luckily, we have **_Object Relational Mappers_**, or **_ORMs_** to take care of the heavy lifting for us!\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='orm.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with an ORM, each row of data gets it's own corresponding object.  This allows us to leverage the power of Object-Oriented Programming while working with data from our relational database!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using SQLAlchemy \n",
    "\n",
    "In python, the most popular ORM is called [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/).    For the remainder of this lesson, we'll review how to connect to a database using SQLAlchemy, and then work through basic CRUD actions using the library (Create, Read, Update, Delete). \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create and connect to our database\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create and establish a connection to our new database with sqlalchemy's create_engine function. The first step is to import this function from the sqlalchemy library at the top of our schema.py file. Then, we will use this function to create a database, in this case musicians.db, with the following lines of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sqlalchemy\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an engine object, and bind it to our database. \n",
    "engine = create_engine('sqlite:///musicians.db', echo=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Technically, the database does not exist yet. We will not create the musicians database until later on when we call the engine variable.  we'll run this code once we've actually created a `Musician` class, later on. At this point, we would likely leave this at the bottom of our file or notebook, since we can't run it until we've actually set everything up. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Declaring A Mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need our Python classes to have the functionality of the **_declarative base class_**. The declarative base is responsible for cataloging our classes and tables. We import the `declarative_base` from the SQLAlchemy library at the top of our Python script with the other dependencies as so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\n",
    "\n",
    "Base = declarative_base()\n",
    "```\n",
    "We will need to import `Column`, `Integer`, `String`, `DateTime`, `ForeignKey` and `Boolean` from the SQLAlchemy library at the top of our file or notebook. By now, we are importing so much of the SQLAlchemy library that it probably makes sense to simply import all using the universal, `*`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`from sqlalchemy import *`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Executing Table Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that engine variable from the very beginning that we left at the bottom of the file? Time to put it to use! We will execute the creation of our database and the musicians table with the code below. The declarative base's `metadata.create_all()` issues the SQL commands so that our database and table are up and running.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Base.metadata.create_all(engine)`\n",
    "\n",
    "All together, our code looks like this so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import everything needed\n",
    "from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\n",
    "from sqlalchemy import * \n",
    "\n",
    "# get a declarative base object\n",
    "Base = declarative_base()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# The code to create the 'Musicians' table will go here. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# The code to create and use the engine goes at the end\n",
    "engine = create_engine('sqlite:///musicians.db', echo=True)\n",
    "Base.metadata.create_all(engine)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: Create the Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "### Construct the` Musicians` Table\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, with all this setup out of the way, we are ready to create a SQL table! We mentioned above that our classes need to have the functionality of the declarative base class. How can we achieve this? We can use object inheritance! By passing our Musician class the Base instance we declared above as an argument, our Musician class will inherit all of the functionality of what commonly is referred to as the parent or super class.\n",
    "\n",
    "`class Musician(Base):`\n",
    "\n",
    "The table's name will be `musicians`, and it should contain the following five columns having these respective data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. id - integer\n",
    "1. fullname - string\n",
    "1. instrument - integer (Foreign key to instruments table)\n",
    "1. dob - datetime\n",
    "1. alive - boolean\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the `musicians` table, we'll also create an `instruments` table by creating an `Instrument` class with the following specifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. id - integer\n",
    "1. name - string\n",
    "1. instrument_type - string\n",
    "\n",
    "To set complete this setup, we'll make our `Musician` class meet all these constraints, like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "class Musician(Base):\n",
    "   # Set the name of the table\n",
    "    __tablename__ = 'musicians'\n",
    "\n",
    "    # declare the columns and set their data types\n",
    "    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True) # Don't forget to set your id as primary key!\n",
    "    fullname = Column(String)\n",
    "    # Create a foreign key to the instruments table. \n",
    "    instrument = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('instruments.id')) # note that foreign key takes the name of the `instruments` table, not the `Instrument` class\n",
    "    dob = Column(DateTime)\n",
    "    alive = Column(Boolean)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class Instrument(Base):\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # set table name\n",
    "    __tablename__ = 'instruments'\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # create columns\n",
    "    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)\n",
    "    name = Column(String)\n",
    "    instrument_type = Column(String)\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings our overall code to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base\n",
