# Section Recap

## Introduction

This short lesson summarizes the topics we covered in section 17 and why they'll be important to you as a data scientist.

## Objectives
You will be able to:

* Understand and explain why this section will help you become a data scientist

## Key Takeaways

APIs can provide access to a wide range of data that you might need as a data scientist. Key takeaways:
* While there are many other kinds of APIs, as a data scientist, you'll typically be working with web APIs
* The Requests library in Python is a great starting point for making http(s) requests to APIs
* The two most common http methods you will use when accessing APIs are GET (to retrive information) and POST (to send information).
* Typically you'll need to authenticate in some manner with most APIs - one common methods for doing so is using OAuth
