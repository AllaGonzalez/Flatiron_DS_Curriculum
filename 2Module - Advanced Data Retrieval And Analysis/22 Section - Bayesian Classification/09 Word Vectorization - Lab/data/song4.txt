Yeah she's nice, yeah she's pretty
And she's crazy about me
She's what every man's hoping to find
She's always a lady, and that's driving me crazy
'Cause after you it's like going
From whiskey to wine
Whiskey to wine
It's just not the same high
I miss the fire
The burning desire
We fought like we loved
And we loved all the time
We're no good together
But it's sure as hell better
Than going forever
From whiskey to wine
When I talk, he listens
He don't show up missing
He's patient, polite and refined
He's handsome, romantic
But the problem is damn it
That after you it's like going
From whiskey to wine
Whiskey to wine
It's just not the same high
I miss the fire
The burning desire
We fought like we loved
And we loved all the time
We're no good together
But it's sure as hell better
Than going forever
From whiskey to wine
It's probably best, we rejoin the rest
And try to have what they call a good time
And hope it's not showing, we're walking in knowing
That we're going from whiskey to wine
