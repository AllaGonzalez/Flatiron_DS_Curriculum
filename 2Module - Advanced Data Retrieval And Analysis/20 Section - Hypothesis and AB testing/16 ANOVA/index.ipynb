    "# ANOVA \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a method for generalizing of previous discussion regarding statistical tests to multiple groups. As we will see, ANOVA then partitions our total sum of square of deviations (from the mean) into sum of squares for each of these groups and sum of squares for error. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Use ANOVA for testing multiple pairwise comparisons\n",
    "* Understand and explain the methodology behind ANOVA tests\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explanation of ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "Again ANOVA generalizes our procedures to test differences, such as in the mean of populations, between multiple groups. We start with sample observations from multiple groups. Since ANOVA is looking to explain the total variance as combinations of variance from the various groups, we typically design a multiple groups experiment to test various independent factors that we hypothesis may influence the overall result. For example, in our A/B testing example of email templates, we could use ANOVA to simultaneously compare the effectiveness of various template changes. The control group could be our original template, and successive groups would have one specific change from that control template. The first group might have a new Subject line but an identical email. Another might have the original subject line but a new greeting within the body of the email. Successive groups would change a singular aspect of the original [control] template, but otherwise be identical. Once we have sample observations from each of these templates, we can then use ANOVA to analyze and compare their effectiveness.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The general idea is to break the sum of square of deviations into multiple parts: the sum of squares of deviations of the mean of each of these test groups to the observations within the group itself, and the sum of squares of deviations of the mean of these test groups to the mean of all observations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's return to our example to illustrate this. ANOVA is looking to describe overall variation from all of our sample observations. The theoretical motivation is that we are looking to break the overall variation apart as a combination of the variation from each of these individual factors as well as unaccounted for error or chance. After all, it is unreasonable to account for all influencing factors. In our email example, we will expect response variation from the people themselves, and while we may break apart our participants into demographic groups, forming additional groups within our ANOVA test, there will continue to be variation within the groups themselves.   \n",
    "\n",
    "After decomposing total variance as variance of the individual factors to their group mean (sum of square for treatments SST) and variance of these groups to the overall mean (sum of square for error SSE), we can compare these quantities using an f-distribution, which becomes our test statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher values of the F-statistic indicate a higher probability of that factor being influential. As with other distributions, we can also quantify this in terms of a desired signifigance level $\\alpha$. For example, if we desire to have a .05 significance level as before, we would be looking for f values such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$F>F_\\alpha$"
