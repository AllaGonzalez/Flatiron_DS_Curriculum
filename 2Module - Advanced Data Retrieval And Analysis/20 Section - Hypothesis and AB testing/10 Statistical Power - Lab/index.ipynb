    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will consider a general-purpose simulation approach to estimating the power of an experimental design. Power analysis is an important aspect of experimental design. It allows us to determine the sample size required to detect an effect of a given size with a given degree of confidence. In other words, it allows us to determine the probability of detecting an effect of a given size with a given level of confidence, under sample size constraints. If this probability is unacceptably low, we would be wise to alter or abandon the experiment.\n",

    "The following four factors have an intimate relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sample size\n",
    "* Effect size\n",
    "* Significance level = P (Type I error) = probability of finding an effect that is not there\n",
    "* **Power = 1 - P (Type II error)** = probability of finding an effect that is there\n",

    "Given any three of these, we can easily determine the fourth.\n",

    "In this lesson, we recieved an understanding around the idea of \"statistical power\" and how sample size, p_value and effect size impact the power of an experiment. We ran a simulation to determine the sample size that would provide a given value of power. In the second simulation, we saw the combined effect of sample size and effect size on the power. We can conclude this lesson with the ideas that a) Statistical power increases as we increase the sample size and b) with a small effect size, we require a large number of samples to achieve required power and vice versa.
