    "In this lesson, we'll look at the law of total probability. In probability theory, the law (or formula) of total probability is a fundamental rule relating **marginal probabilities** to conditional probabilities. It expresses the total probability of an outcome which can be realized via several distinct events.\n",

    "* State the law of total probabilities based on a partitioned event space\n",
    "* Understand and able to perform partitioning based on known and unknown probabilities to solve a problem\n",
