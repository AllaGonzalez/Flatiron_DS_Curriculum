    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Parameter Inference\" is one of the most important concepts of predictive machine learning. In this lesson, we will try to build an intuition and develop a sound understanding of the the ideas around this concept. We will first look at the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for the posterior probability based on observed data. The lesson explains the context of a random experiment involving a series of coin tosses to conclude the general formula for MLE for a binomial distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Understand and describe parametric inference based in context of identifying optimal values for model parameters\n",
    "* Understand the concept of likelihood , and the difference between likelihood and a probability\n",
    "* Describe MLE assumption of IID samples and its implications on model development\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parameter Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter Inference is the process of probabilistically inferring parameter(s) for a model of our choice, that is which parameter values best describe the underlying dataset, used in an analytical context. Let's try to understand this with a simple experiment with a 10 times coin flip and inspecting the outcome. "
