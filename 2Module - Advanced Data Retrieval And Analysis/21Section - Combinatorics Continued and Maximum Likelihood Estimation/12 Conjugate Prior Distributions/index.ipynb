    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In Bayesian probability theory, if the posterior distributions p(θ | X) are in the same probability distribution family as the prior probability distribution p(θ), the prior and posterior are then called conjugate distributions, and the prior is called a conjugate prior for the likelihood function. Here we shall look at the case of bernoulli distribution and see how we can use a beta prior in this case, with quick references to other use cases. \n",

    "## Objectives\n",

    "You will be able to:\n",
    "* Understand and describe what a conjugate prior is\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's think again of our coin toss example, where we want to learn weather coin is fair or not. $P(\\theta)$ on RHS represents our belief about $\\theta$. We can say that based on our prior experience with other coins we estimate $\\theta$ to be around 0.5 - A subjective prior. However this is just our belief and could be wrong in case of a used up , slightly biased coin. To model our belief about $\\theta$ we need another distribution. Theoretically, we are free to select any distribution, but using some random distribution makes the whole calculation very difficult. It turns out that if select a distribution for $P(\\theta)$ that has the same form as of $P(\\theta|X)$ then the whole computation becomes much easier.  In this case, \n",

    "In this lesson we looked at the idea of using a conjugate priors for Bayesian inferencing. These section might be getting a bit heavy on the mathematics, without showing great details on the applications of Bayes in real life scenarios, other than coin toss experiments. The understanding from this chapter will be used throughout the machine learning sections of our course. And you will have ample chance to revisit these equations for a deeper dive. At this stage , we expect you to have a conceptual understanding of the Bayesian Inference process. Let's move on to our last lab to run some simulations around Bayesian inferencing, using the good old coin toss examples. "
