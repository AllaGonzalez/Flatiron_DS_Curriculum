    "In this lab , we looked at some more examples of simple problems using law of total probability. We also attempted to run simulations to solve these problems by continuous random sampling. We saw that we get almost the same results through random sampling as we do from solving mathematical equations. consider the difference in computation while running these simulations and calculating a simple formula. For much complex problems with larger datasets, having an understanding the underlying probabilities can help you solve a lot of optimization problems as we shall see ahead. "
