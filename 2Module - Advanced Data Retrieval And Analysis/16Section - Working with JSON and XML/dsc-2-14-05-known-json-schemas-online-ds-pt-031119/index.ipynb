    "We've started taking a look at JSON files and we'll continue to explore how to navigate and traverse these files. One common use case of json files will be when we are connecting to various websites through their established APIs to retrieve data from them. With these, we are typically given a schema for how the data is structured and then will use this knowledge to retrieve pertinant information. In this lecture, we'll take a look at the response from the NY Times API."
