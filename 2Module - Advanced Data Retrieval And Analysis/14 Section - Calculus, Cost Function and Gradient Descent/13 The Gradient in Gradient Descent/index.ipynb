    "As you know, we entered our discussion of derivatives to determine size and direction of a step with which to move along a cost curve.  We first used a derivative in a single variable function to see how the output of our cost curve changed with respect to change a change in one of our regression line's variables.  Then we learned about partial derivatives to see how a *three dimensional cost curve* responded to a change in the regression line.  \n",

However, it is somewhat easier to understand gradient *ascent* than descent, and the two are quite related, so that's where we'll begin.  Gradient ascent, as you could guess, simply means that we want to move in the direction of steepest ascent.\n",

Because with gradient ascent our goal is to make a nudge in $x, y$ that produces the greatest change in output, if $\\frac{df}{dy} > \\frac{df}{dx}$, we should make that move more in the $y$ direction than the $x$ direction, and vice versa.  That is, we want to get the biggest bang for our buck.  \n",

    "Let's relate this again to the picture of our mountain climbers. Imagine the vertical edge on the left is our y-axis and the horizontal edge is on the bottom is our x-axis.  For the climber in the yellow jacket, imagine his step size is three feet. A step straight along the y-axis will move him further upwards than a step along the x-axis.  So in taking that step he should direct himself more towards the y-axis than the x-axis.  That will produce a bigger increase per step size."

    "In fact, the direction of greatest ascent for a function,  $\\nabla f(x, y)$, is the direction which is a proportion of $\\frac{df}{dy}$ steps in the $y$ direction and $\\frac{df}{dx}$ in the $x$ direction.  So, for example, if $\\frac{df}{dy}$ = 5 and $\\frac{df}{dx}$ = 1, the direction of gradient ascent is five times more in the $y$ direction than the $x$ direction.  And this seems to be the path, more or less that our climbers are taking - some combination of $x$ and $y$, but tilted more towards the $y$ direction."

    "So this path maps up well to what we see visually.  That is the idea behind gradient descent.  The gradient is the partial derivative with respect to each type of variable of a multivariable function, in this case $x$ and $y$.  And the importance of the gradient is that it's direction is the direction of steepest ascent.  The negative gradient, that is the negative of each of the partial derivatives, is the direction of steepest descent.  So our direction of gradient descent for the graph above is $x = -2$, $y = -3$.  And looking at the two graphs above, it seems that the steepest downward direction is just the opposite of the steepest upward direction.  We get that by mathematically by simply taking the multiplying our partial derivatives by negative one."

So $\\nabla f(x, y) = \\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta y}, \\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta x} $.  This means that to take the path of greatest ascent, we should move $ \\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta y} $ divided by $ \\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta x} $.  So for example, when $ \\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta y}f(x, y)  = 3 $ , and $ \\frac{\\delta f}{\\delta x}f(x, y)  = 2$, we travelled in line with a slope of 3/2.\n",
