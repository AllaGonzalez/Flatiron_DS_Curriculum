    "In this section, we both learned how to traverse a cost function graph to find the local minima to solve a linear regression by using a gradient descent and covered some of the foundational calculus that will help you to understand many of the other machine learning models you'll encounter as a professional data scientist. Key takeaways include:\n",
    "* A derivative is the \"instantaneous rate of change\" of a function - or it can be thought of as the \"slope of the curve\" at a point in time\n",
    "* A derivative can also be thought of as a special case of the rate of change over a period of time - as that period of time tends to zero. \n",
    "* If you calculate the rate of change over a period of time and keep reducing the period of time, it usually tends to a limit - which is the value of that derivative\n",
    "* The power rule, constant factor rule and addition rule are key tools for calculating derivatives for various kinds of functions\n",
    "* The chain rule can be a useful tool for calculating the derivate of a complex function\n",
    "* A derivative can be useful for identifying local maxima or minima as in both cases, the derviative tends to zero\n",
    "* A cost curve can be used to plot the values of a cost function (in the case of linear regression) for various values of offset and slope for the best fit line.\n",
    "* A gradient descent can be used to move towards the local minima on the cost curve and thus the ideal values for offset and slope to minimize the selected cost function\n",
