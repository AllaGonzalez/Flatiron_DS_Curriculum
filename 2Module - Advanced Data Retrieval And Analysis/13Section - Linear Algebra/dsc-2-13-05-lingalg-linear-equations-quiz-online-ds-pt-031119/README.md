# Systems of Linear Equations - Quiz

## Introduction
Following scenarios present problems that can be solved as system of equations, while performing substitutions and eliminations as we saw in the previous lesson. 

* Solve these problems by hand, showing all the steps to work out the unknown variable values 
* Verify your answers by showing the calculated values satisfy all equations

## Objectives
You will be able to:
* Describe a system of linear equations for solving simple analytical problems
* Solve a system of equations using elimination and substitution

## Exercise 1
#### Joe paid 12 dollars for 4 cups of coffee and 4 cups of tea. 3 cups of coffee cost as much as 2 cups of tea. 

#### What would be the total cost of 5 cups of coffee and 5 cups of tea ?

## Solution

> Let x be the unit price of coffee and y be the unit price of tea


```python
# Your solution here 
```

## Exercise 2

#### Jim has more money than Bob.  If Jim gave Bob 20 dollars , they would have the same amount.  While if Bob gave Jim 22 dollars, Jim would then have twice as much as Bob. 

#### How much does each one actually have?

## Solution
> Let x be the amount of money that Jim has and y be the amount that Bob has.


```python
# Your solution here 
```

## Exercise 3

#### Mia has 30 coins, consisting of quarters (25 cents) and dimes (10 cents), which total to the amount 5.70 dollars.  
#### How many of each does she have?


```python
# Your solution here 
```

## Summary
In this lesson, we saw how to solve linear equations by hand to find the co-efficient values. We shall now move forward to have a deeper look into vectors and matrices and how Python and Numpy can help us solve more complex equations in an analytical context.
