    "## Basic HTML Document Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "All HTML documents begin with a \"doctype declaration\" tag, which tells our web\n",
    "browser which version of HTML to use. HTML is a language that is currently\n",
    "evolving &mdash; just like English. When we open \"Romeo and Juliet,\" our\n",
    "expectation is that the \"doctype\" is \"Elizabethan English.\" In the same way\n",
    "\"Elizabethan English\" has changed to a more modern form, HTML 1.0 was\n",
    "_essentially_ the same as modern HTML5 but had some tags we don't use any more\n",
    "and was lacking some tags we use often today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it's not wrapping any content, our doctype declaration doesn't require a\n",
    "closing tag. To use HTML5, the current up-to-date version, we can simply\n",
    "declare `<!DOCTYPE html>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we add an opening and closing `html` tag. This tells the web browser to\n",
    "interpret everything inside the tags as HTML code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Every HTML page is made up of two primary sections: a `head` and a `body`. The\n",
    "`head` element contains metadata about the HTML document and other information\n",
    "for the browser, while the `body` element contains the actual content.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "    <head>\n",
    "        <!-- metadata about the HTML document as a whole -->\n",
    "\n",
    "    </head>\n",
    "\n",
    "    <body>\n",
    "        <!-- content of our page will be here! -->\n",
    "\n",
    "    </body>\n",

    "## Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's also take a brief moment to recognize how to add comments into an HTML\n",
    "document.  These won't get rendered to the browser at all: they're just helpful\n",
    "notes for the author.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",

    "## Common HTML Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already looked at some common HTML elements, such as `a` and `p`. Let's\n",
    "take a look at some more HTML elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Headers\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML gives us access to different header elements, ranging from `h1` to `h6`,\n",
    "with `h1` being the largest and `h6` being the smallest.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<h1>Dogs!</h1>\n",
    "<h3>Why Dogs are Great</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h6>Different Breeds</h6>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to changing how the text is displayed, search engines use headers\n",
    "to help determine what a web page is about. Remember, as Avi pointed out, when\n",
    "we provide _semantic_ markup, machines can infer the \"main points\" of a page. A\n",
    "well structured article will generally have its principal arguments bracketed\n",
    "by low-number header tags -- this very document does exactly that!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Images\n",
    "\n",
    "We can embed images on our web pages using the `img` element. The `img` element\n",
    "doesn't have a closing tag. The `src` attribute tells the browser where to find\n",
    "the image. The `alt` attribute will be displayed if an image can't be loaded,\n",
    "and also describes the image to search engines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `alt` tag presents a moment to talk about an important principle behind Tim\n",
    "Berners-Lee's vision for the Web: it is _inclusive_. If you're using assistive\n",
    "technologies because you have a sight impairment, it's helpful to know what's\n",
    "being displayed. If you're in a remote community where internet access is\n",
    "expensive, you might choose to disable images and only pay to download those\n",
    "which you _absolutely need_. So while an `img` will inject an image and \"work,\"\n",
    "honoring the Web's vision for openness and inclusivity requires that we provide\n",
    "the `alt` tag as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "`<img src=\"URL_TO_IMAGE\" alt=\"Picture of a Dog\">`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other useful HTML elements are lists. We can make bulleted, or unordered\n",
    "lists, using opening and closing `ul` tags. Inside, we can nest an `li`, or\n",
    "\"list item\" element for each item on our list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<h5>My Favorite Things in No Particular Order</h5>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Coffee</li>\n",
    "    <li>Vinyl Records</li>\n",
    "    <li>Pickling</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "</ul>\n",
    "____\n",
