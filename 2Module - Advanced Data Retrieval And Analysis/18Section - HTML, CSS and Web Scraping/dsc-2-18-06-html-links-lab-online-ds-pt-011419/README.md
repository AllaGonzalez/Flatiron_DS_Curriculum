# HTML Links - Lab

## Introduction
We've got our HTML tags and we've got our HTML tag attributes. How do we use them together? We can figure it out by exploring the `a` tag and creating a link. In this lab, you'll do just that.

## Objectives
You will be able to:
* Code an `a`nchor tag that defines an HTML hyperlink

## Use a `a` Tag to Create a Link

Open `index.html` in your text editor (the in-browser IDE). Add an `a` tag with the inner text (the
text between the `<a>` tag and the `</a>` tag) of
`Flatiron School` anywhere in the file. Then set the `href` attribute of your
new link element to `https://flatironschool.com`.

You can run the tests with this lab via `learn` in the "terminal" of the in-browser IDE. Make sure you save the file before running the test suite. Failing tests will provide helpful error messages that you can use to debug your code â€” read them closely for hints!

## Viewing Your Work in the Browser

While working through these assignments, your general workflow should center on
writing code in the text editor (the in-browser IDE) and periodically running the test suite in the
terminal below it to check your work.

Another great way to track your progress is to open up the HTML document in your
browser and watch how each change you make in the text editor affects the visual
layout in the browser. Do that by running the `httpserver` command in the terminal window in the in-browser IDE and then copying the URL from the terminal and then pasting that into your web browser followed by the path to the file you want to view.

Once you have the HTML document open in your browser, you can make changes to it
in the text editor, save the file, refresh the page in the browser, and see the
changes instantly.

## Summary

Here we saw how an attribute helps the `a` tag do its job, which is to link to another location. Now we can go on to explore some additional HTML tags.
