    "When developers first began defining containers to structure HTML, they had only\n",
    "one generic element available to them: the `div`. Creating complex page layouts\n",
    "then required dozens of `div` elements that were often difficult to organize or\n",
    "locate within the code. HTML authors needed a way to distinguish one `div` from another,\n",
    "which led to `id` and `class` attributes on elements being misused in an attempt\n",
    "to communicate what the `div` was doing. For example, a document usually has\n",
    "only one header, so it seemed sensible to write `div id=\"header\"` as a way to\n",
    "say something stronger than, \"this is a text division.\" Developers wanted to\n",
    "say, \"this is a special division of introduction,\" but lacked the specific language\n",
    "to express it. They wanted those sections to have a _semantic meaning_ (more on that later). But the\n",
    "HTML language simply didn't have the ability to meet this need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, many HTML authors\n",
    "thought that this was a good idea and an informal standard sprang up around\n",
    "adding `id` attributes on elements to express their \"semantic meaning.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div id=\"header\">\n",
    "  <div class=\"wrapper\">...</div>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When the W3C (the organization that oversees the specifications for HTML and\n",
    "CSS) started writing the specification for HTML5 they wanted to create new\n",
    "elements that would eliminate the need to label so many `div` elements. The\n",
    "goals were to make the code more readable for developers and more descriptive\n",
    "for browsers. It turned out that many developers were already using the same\n",
    "names to label their elements, such as `id=\"header\"`, `id=\"footer\"`, `id=\"nav\"`,\n",
    "`class=\"article\"`, etc. So HTML5 provided semantic elements that explicitly\n",
    "described those functions for developers to use instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "We once used to have to identify a `div` as our header section.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<div id=\"header\">...</div>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we use the `header` element.\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<header></header>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we call these _semantic_ elements? Semantic elements are elements that\n",
    "we use when the content within the element all has the same related _meaning_.\n",
    "In our `header` example above, all the content we would put within the `header`\n",
    "element would relate to introductory content, such as titles or navigation."
