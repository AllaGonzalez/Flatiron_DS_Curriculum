I get this feeling that I can't explain
Every time I see your face or hear your name
I just go crazy, thinking, baby, this may be my chance
What would you say to me if I said "Baby, let's lay down and dance"
I got to tell you, girl, you drive me wild
Every time I see you dance I see that smile
My world gets hazy and I'm moving like I'm in a trance
Whoa, I know it's crazy, but baby, let's lay down and dance
When it comes to love my heart is black and it's blue
Swore I was through with romance
But girl you're something and I'm counting on you
You're my brand new second chance
My friends all tell me that I'm not your kind
They say I better pray your love is blind
You got to save me, I'm a victim of your circumstance
Whoa, I know it's crazy, but baby, let's lay down and dance
When it comes to love my heart is black and it's blue
Swore I was through with romance
But girl you're something and I'm counting on you
You're my brand new second chance
I got to tell you, girl, you drive me wild
I've never known no one with quite your style
I'm going crazy, thinking, baby, this may be my chance
What would you say to me if I said "Baby, let's lay down and dance"
Girl, I know it's crazy, but baby, let's lay down and dance
