We took Ventura Highway to the Sunshine State
Where they raised their hands to Jesus as they passed the plate
Oh, and every day we spent there was Valentine's day
There's a new team, out in Queens, 8teen
And the girl made in Japan was made for me to hold
When Vincent lent an ear the night the thunder rolled
And the ride we took together was a rodeo
Big dreams, six strings, 8teen
And for everyone born 8teen runnin' wild and free
From the pearly gates of Heaven to the fiery sea
Know that each will teach of passage through the trinity
God's gift runneth 'ore my cup
Call it a blessing or you call it luck
It all adds up to 8teen
And we heard about the letters kept beside his bed
And how he never could forget her or the words she said
That will forever be enshrined and underlined in red
Such sad scenes, so pristine, 8teen
He rode that silver bullet 'cross the borderline
There beneath the maple leaf signed to the Nimbus 9
And the song he hummed that night moves me every time
Fourteen, and so green, 8teen
And for everyone born 8teen runnin' wild and free
From the pearly gates of Heaven to the fiery sea
Know that each will teach of passage through the trinity
God's gift runneth 'ore my cup
Call it a blessing or you call it luck
It all adds up to 8teen
Forever frozen now in time
The night the miracle occurred
They walked on water in my mind
JC and Uncle Herb
Though we never heard the words
It all adds up to 8teen
And for everyone born 8teen runnin' wild and free
From the pearly gates of Heaven to the fiery sea
Know that each will teach of passage through the trinity
God's gift runneth 'ore my cup
Call it a blessing or you call it luck
It all adds up to 8teen
