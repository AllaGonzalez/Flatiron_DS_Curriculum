Help me, 911 operator, got a Friday night emergency
I need nursin' cause I'm hurtin' from a long week workin'
And I'm thirstin' for a remedy
I need a red-head, brunette, or blonde
Angel have mercy that will put me through intensive care
There's gotta be a honky-tonk somewhere
Hang on, don't hang up on me lady
Gotta take me to the promised land
Cause I'm dying to see something like a jukejoint jumpin'
To the thumpin' little five piece band
I need a red dirt n swingin'
Anything that's country
Karaoke, I don't care
There's gotta be a honky-tonk somewhere
There's gotta be a honky-tonk somewhere
There's gotta be a honky-tonk
Girl you gotta get me there
I've tried the phone at the road
Mapped Siri, where's the party at
That ain't got me anywhere
There's gotta be a honky-tonk somewhere
Last call, answer operater
I'm afraid I'm runnin' out of time
I know I sound broken but I just keep hopin'
for an open glowin' neon sign
Maybe this is crazy but I'm thinkin' baby
Maybe later you could meet me there
There's gotta be a honky-tonk somewhere
There's gotta be a honky-tonk somewhere
There's gotta be a honky-tonk
Girl you gotta get me there
I've tried the phone at the road
Mapped Siri, where's the party at
That ain't got me anywhere
There's gotta be a honky-tonk somewhere
Out there's gotta be a honky-tonk somewhere
