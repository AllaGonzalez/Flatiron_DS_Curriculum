Try it if it feels right (try it)
Try it if it feels right, yah
When you try
Ohh, ohh
[Jorja Smith:]
I'm trying
I'm just, I'm just
I been out here tryin' to see my homecoming
And of course somebody is always gonna say something
Try and shoot me down for voicing my own opinion
Triggering a part of me that's always been indifferent
And I know that we have asked for change
Don't be scared to put the fears to shame
When you know what you got
Sacrifice ain't that hard
Feel like depending on me
Sometimes we ain't meant to be free
When you know what you got
Sacrifice ain't that hard
Feel like depending on me
Sometimes we ain't meant to be free
Open up this letter, you ain't tryin' to be
You been blind to the subject but not blind to me
And I know that this margin ain't too small to me
Not too real, not too much anymore, not alone
And I know that we have asked for change
Don't be scared to put the fears to shame
When you know what you got
Sacrifice ain't that hard
Feel like depending on me
Sometimes we ain't meant to be free
When you know what you got
Sacrifice ain't that hard
Feel like depending on me
Sometimes we ain't meant to be free
[Jorja Smith (Kendrick Lamar):]
If who I am offends you
Don't feel sorry
Don't feel, don't feel sorry
Don't feel, don't feel sorry
(My loss is worth more than your wins)
(I'm satisfied if it starts to look in)
That is everything, that is everything, that is everything
That is everything
That is everything
I try to make it stop
I do want you want to stop
I try to make it stop
I do want you want to stop
I try to make it stop
I do want you want to stop
I try to make it stop
I do want you want to stop
I try to make it stop
I do want you want to stop
