Five o'clock traffic, all four lanes are down to a crawl
He's sitting there knowing that he's going nowhere at all
Then finally he sees the wreck
And says a prayer for whoever they are
Then everything changes the second he sees it's her car
He really loves you
And God knows it's true
And it's something he'd say
And he'd tell you each day
It was the way that He knew
But to some of us guys, you don't realize
How to say it is just not what we do
And it's so hard to see, but take it from me
He really loves you
Down on the shoulder, he's running as fast as he can
Dying to hold her, he's truly a desperate man
And he falls to his knees at the wreck
Up close it all looks so much worse
Same color, same model, but the car in the crash isn't hers
He really loves you
And God knows it's true
And it's something he'd say
And he'd tell you each day
It was the way that He knew
But to some of us guys, you don't realize
How to say it is just not what we do
And it's so hard to see, but take it from me
He really loves you
I come home tonight like everything is alright
But nothing's changed, but it's simply not true
Been there today, and you'd see the way
He really loves you
