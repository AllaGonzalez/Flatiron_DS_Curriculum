My head is aching, and I'm late for work
There's a girl in the kitchen, and she's wearing my shirt
My buddies are home again, they're threatening to leave
Yes that beer on my nightstand will be breakfast for me
Cause that's how it goes with cowboys and friends
As soon as it's over, it all starts again
That's the way that it should be
Cause that's the way that it's been
Yeah the fun never ends, when the party begins
Cowboys and friends
I've been working all morning, just busting my back
And it's all for a foreman who doesn't know jack
My buddies keep talking, they say we're going out late
Guess that sleep that I'm wanting will just have to wait
Cause that's how it goes with cowboys and friends
As soon as it's over, it all starts again
That's the way that it should be
Cause that's the way that it's been
Yeah the fun never ends, when the party begins
Cowboys and friends
Yeah the party begins where this two lane road ends
Cowboys and friends
