Well, sun up, means sundown somewhere
Wake up, I wanna take you out there
Let's go, wherever it's the weekend
'Cause, Lord knows, this world needs to unwind
So, let's show 'em how to have a good time
Let go baby, it's the weekend
From western Montana to south Louisiana
I even hear the doors are now open in Havana
It's the weekend all over the world
You know, they're snakin' the cabanas down in Savannah
I bet they're all laughing and loving in Vienna
It's the weekend all over the world
So, jump in, to good times and good love
With good friends you just can't get enough of
We're all in, baby, it's the weekend
You know, you're rocking in Atlanta, dancing in Guyana
I swear, I hear 'em singing in sweet home Alabama
It's the weekend all over the world
They're on the track in Indiana, they're chantin' in Siena
Here we are, you and me still in our pajamas
It's the weekend all over the world, weekend all over the world
Weekend all over the world
You know they're rockin' in Atlanta
Rollin' in Havana
Champaign-Urbana
Muncie, Indiana
