There's a storm that is coming
Everyone is running away
But you hear a different drummer drumming
You've waited your whole life for this one day
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Time to unleash the beast inside
Time to show the world what you are all about
Now, it's kickin' in, pure adrenaline
No one's ever been where you're standin'
Of the multitudes, God has chosen you
Time to dial it in, pure adrenaline
There's a long stretch of highway
And you know that's where they're makin' their move
You could pass on some forgotten byway
But you're young and you've got something to prove
Don't want to run, don't want to hide
Time to unleash the beast inside
Time to show them all what you are all about
Now, it's kickin' in, pure adrenaline
No one's ever been where you're standin'
Of the multitudes, God has chosen you
Time to dial it in, pure adrenaline
Time for lift off so you better be ready to dance
Fate's done pissed off
gonna kill you if you give him a chance
Now, it's kickin' in, pure adrenaline
No one's ever been where you're standin'
Of the multitudes, God has chosen you
Time to dial it in, pure adrenaline
Pure adrenaline, pure adrenaline, pure adrenaline
Time to dial it in
Pure adrenaline
