    "## Introduction\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifiers are a **family of probabilistic classifiers** based on Bayes' theorem, with an assumption that each feature is independent from one another. Previously we looked at the learning mechanism of this classifier in terms of maximizing the posterior probability. In this lab we shall learn to code a **Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier** from scratch , and also learn to use scikitlearn library for this task.   \n",
