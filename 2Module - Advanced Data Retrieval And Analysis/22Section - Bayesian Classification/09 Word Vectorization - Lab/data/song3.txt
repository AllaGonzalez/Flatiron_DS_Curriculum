She worked the window at the Desert Sands
Clyde was a dealer who was gifted with the sleight of hand
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
Their petty thieving and conniving ways
Would never get 'em to that beach house of their dreams someday
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
But every afternoon at four that armored car rolled to the door (like before)
Bang! Bang!
The doors swing open and the pick-up begins
Bang! Bang!
The guard knocks, she lets him in
Bang! Bang!
Two bangs of cash hit the floor
The guard asks her out, she turns him down and shows him the door (once more)
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
They must have run through it a thousand times
But something happened on the evening of their perfect crime
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
It seems the set up and the switch all play
But there's a problem when it gets down to the get away
Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
So, to complete their master plan
They're gonna need a pick-up man (meet Jo-Ann)
Bang! Bang! Bang!
It's four on Monday and the hustle begins
Bang! Bang! Bang!
The guard knocks, she lets him in
Bang! Bang! Bang!
The bags of cash hit the floor
Clyde's hiding out, he swaps 'em out
The guard's out the door (they score)
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Bang! Bang! Bang!
Two big bags of money and they're both feeling light
She sees the guard is stopping, she knows when something's not right
When he turns to find he's standing face to face now with her
She says "how 'bout dinner Friday
And if you're good I'll let you have dessert"
Bang! Bang!
The guard is happy and he's gone in a flash
Bang! Bang!
She grabs Clyde and the cash
Bang! Bang!
They see Jo-Ann and jump in
They were last seen heading West and never heard from again
The end
Bang! Bang!
Amen
Bang! Bang!
